# **Gun Control and Safety in Nevada**

A Systemic Analysis for Voters

*Prepared for NVGov2026 Civic Information Project | December 2025*

# **Executive Summary**

Gun policy in Nevada occupies a unique position in the American landscape. The state has experienced one of the nation's deadliest mass shootings—the October 1, 2017 Route 91 Harvest festival attack that killed 60 people—while maintaining a strong gun-rights tradition rooted in its Western heritage. Since 2017, Nevada has enacted significant gun safety reforms under Democratic leadership, moving from what advocacy groups rated as an "F" grade to a "B-" on gun law strength rankings.

However, legislative progress has stalled since Governor Joe Lombardo (R) took office in 2023\. Lombardo has vetoed every gun safety bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in both the 2023 and 2025 sessions—a total of six vetoes on measures including prohibiting firearms at polling places, raising the purchase age for semi-automatic weapons to 21, and barring those convicted of hate crimes from possessing firearms.

This creates a defining tension for the 2026 gubernatorial race: polling consistently shows strong bipartisan public support for gun safety measures (75-83% support for key policies), yet executive action has blocked implementation. The outcome of this election will determine whether Nevada continues its post-2017 trajectory toward stronger regulations or reverses course.

# **1\. Jurisdiction & Regulatory Framework**

## **1.1 Governing Authority**

**Primary Authority:** Nevada Legislature and Governor, with county sheriffs implementing concealed carry permitting

**Regulatory Bodies:** Nevada Department of Public Safety (background checks via Central Repository); County Sheriffs (CCW permits)

**State Preemption:** Nevada has complete state preemption over local firearms laws (NRS 244.364, NRS 268.418). Cities and counties cannot enact stricter gun regulations than state law, except for discharge regulations.

**Federal Overlay:** ATF regulates federal firearms licensees; NICS background check system; federal prohibitions on machine guns, certain individuals possessing firearms

## **1.2 Key Statutes & Regulations**

| Statute/Law | What It Does |
| :---- | :---- |
| NRS 202.2544-202.2549 (SB 143, 2019\) | Universal background checks for all firearm transfers, including private sales, with exemptions for family transfers, hunting, and self-defense. Effective January 2, 2020\. |
| NRS 33.500-33.670 (AB 291, 2019\) | Extreme Risk Protection Orders ("red flag law"). Allows family members, household members, or law enforcement to petition courts to temporarily remove firearms from individuals posing risk to themselves or others. |

# **2\. Gun Violence in Nevada: Key Metrics**

## **2.1 Current Statistics (2023 Data)**

| Metric | Nevada Data |
| :---- | :---- |
| Total gun deaths (2023) | 616 people |
| Gun death rate | 18.4 per 100,000 (34% above national average) |
| National ranking | 15th highest gun death rate |
| Gun suicides | 68% of gun deaths (60% above national suicide rate) |
| Gun homicides | 29% of gun deaths |
| Gun law strength grade (Giffords) | B- (ranked \#19 nationally) |
| Economic cost (annual) | $6.7 billion ($2,026 per person) |

## **2.2 Demographic Disparities**

* Black Nevadans are 8x more likely to die by gun homicide than white Nevadans  
* Black males ages 15-34 represent 1.5% of population but 18% of gun homicide victims  
* White males over 34 account for 51% of gun suicide deaths  
* Males are 3x more likely to die by gun homicide than females  
* Firearms are leading cause of death for Nevadans ages 1-17

## **2.3 Geographic Variation**

Gun death rates vary significantly across Nevada counties:

* **Highest:** Nye County (49.3 per 100,000)  
* **Lowest:** Clark County (17.2 per 100,000)  
* Rural counties (Humboldt, Elko, Nye) have consistently higher rates than urban areas

## **2.4 Major Incidents**

**Route 91 Harvest Festival (October 1, 2017):** A gunman fired from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay hotel onto a country music festival, killing 60 people and injuring over 850\. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The shooter used bump stocks to increase the rate of fire, leading to federal and state bans on these devices.

**UNLV Shooting (December 6, 2023):** Three faculty members were killed and one injured in a planned attack on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus.

**Mass shootings since 2020:** Nevada has experienced 25 mass shootings (incidents with 4+ victims shot) since 2020\.

# **3\. Key Actors & Incentives**

## **3.1 Government Actors**

### **Governor**

**Role:** Signs or vetoes gun legislation; sets enforcement priorities

**Current:** Joe Lombardo (R), former Clark County Sheriff. Has vetoed 6 gun safety bills across two legislative sessions (2023, 2025).

**Incentives:** Balance base support (gun-rights conservatives) with general election electorate; law enforcement background shapes approach

### **Legislature**

**Role:** Passes gun legislation; can override vetoes with 2/3 majority

**Current composition:** Democrats control both chambers but lack supermajority to override vetoes

**Key figure:** Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas), Route 91 survivor, sponsors major gun safety legislation

### **Attorney General**

**Role:** Enforces gun laws; provides legal opinions on enforceability; trains law enforcement

**Current:** Aaron Ford (D), running for Governor in 2026\. Has promoted red flag law training, defended ghost gun ban in court.

**Historical note:** Former AG Adam Laxalt (R) issued 2016 opinion that Question 1 background checks were unenforceable, delaying implementation until 2020\.

### **County Sheriffs**

**Role:** Issue CCW permits; enforce state gun laws; may petition for red flag orders

**Variation:** Rural sheriffs (Elko, Humboldt) joined 2019 lawsuit opposing red flag law; urban sheriffs (Clark, Washoe) generally supportive of regulations

## **3.2 Advocacy Organizations**

| Organization | Position | Activities |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Gun Safety** |  |  |
| Everytown for Gun Safety | Universal background checks, red flag laws, safe storage | Funded Question 1 (2016); endorses candidates; conducts polling |
| Moms Demand Action | Grassroots gun safety advocacy | Lobbying, testimony, voter mobilization |
| Giffords Law Center | Research-based policy advocacy | Annual state rankings; model legislation |
| **Gun Rights** |  |  |
| NRA-ILA | Oppose new restrictions; protect 2nd Amendment | Campaign contributions; lobbying; voter alerts |
| Nevada Firearms Coalition | NRA state affiliate; oppose gun control | Legislative lobbying; candidate ratings; education programs |
| Firearms Policy Coalition | Constitutional gun rights litigation | Legal challenges to gun laws (challenged ghost gun ban) |

# **4\. Structural Tensions & Tradeoffs**

These are conflicts inherent to the system—not merely political disagreements—that thoughtful people across the political spectrum acknowledge.

## **Tension 1: Democratic Will vs. Executive Power**

**Dynamics:** Nevada voters approved universal background checks by ballot initiative in 2016\. The Democratic-controlled legislature has passed gun safety measures in multiple sessions with majority support. Yet gubernatorial vetoes have blocked additional reforms.

**Tradeoff:** The veto power serves as a check against rushed legislation but can also block measures with clear popular support. Democrats lack the supermajority needed to override.

**Who bears costs:** Gun safety advocates and those who voted for reforms see their preferences blocked. Gun rights advocates benefit from the status quo.

## **Tension 2: Urban Safety vs. Rural Culture**

**Dynamics:** Nevada's gun debate maps onto its urban-rural divide. Clark County (Las Vegas) overwhelmingly passed Question 1 in 2016; most rural counties opposed it. Rural Nevadans have higher gun ownership rates, longer emergency response times (making self-defense more salient), and stronger hunting traditions.

**Tradeoff:** Statewide regulations may not account for rural realities (e.g., private sales on BLM land), while local variation is prohibited by preemption.

**Who bears costs:** Rural gun owners face compliance burdens designed for urban contexts. Urban residents cannot enact local measures beyond state law.

## **Tension 3: Rights vs. Risk Reduction**

**Dynamics:** Red flag laws allow temporary firearm removal based on risk assessment, not criminal conviction. Supporters see this as preventing tragedies; opponents see it as due process violation.

**Tradeoff:** Intervening before violence occurs requires acting on predictive risk, which inherently involves judgment calls. Waiting for criminal behavior may be too late.

**Evidence:** Nevada's ERPO has been used sparingly (61 orders filed 2020-2024), suggesting either underutilization or careful restraint depending on perspective.

## **Tension 4: Enforcement Capacity vs. Legislative Ambition**

**Dynamics:** Universal background check laws are difficult to enforce for truly private sales. Rural sheriffs have openly opposed enforcement. Red flag law utilization remains low despite training investment.

**Tradeoff:** Laws that cannot be widely enforced may still deter behavior and establish norms, or may simply burden law-abiding citizens while criminals ignore them.

**Who bears costs:** Compliant gun owners bear transaction costs; those who ignore the law face low prosecution risk.

# **5\. Public Opinion**

Polling consistently shows majority support for gun safety measures across party lines, though views on whether stricter laws reduce violence are more divided.

## **5.1 Support for Specific Policies (2022-2025 Polling)**

| Policy | Support | Oppose |
| :---- | :---: | :---: |
| Universal background checks | 83% | — |
| Raise age for semi-auto purchase to 21 | 77% | — |
| Prohibit guns at polling places | 70% | — |
| Mental health checks on gun buyers | 70% | — |
| Red flag laws | 69% | 17% |
| Ban high-capacity magazines | 60% | 27% |
| Ban assault-style weapons | 54% | 34% |

*Source: Nevada Independent/OHPI Poll (2022), Everytown polling (2025)*

## **5.2 Cross-Partisan Support**

2025 Everytown polling found that raising the semi-automatic purchase age to 21 was supported by:

* 77% of all Nevada voters  
* 69% of Republicans  
* 69% of concealed carry permit holders  
* 68% of gun owners

# **6\. Recent Legislative History**

## **6.1 Laws Enacted (2016-2023)**

**2016:** Question 1 passes (universal background checks), but AG Laxalt declares unenforceable

**2019:** SB 143 implements universal background checks (effective 2020); AB 291 creates red flag law, bans bump stocks, child access prevention; signed by Gov. Sisolak

**2021:** AB 286 bans ghost guns (later challenged, upheld by Nevada Supreme Court in 2024\)

**2023:** SB 294 requires dealers to provide gun locks and post safe storage notices

## **6.2 Vetoed Legislation (2023-2025)**

| Bill | What It Would Have Done | Governor's Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2023 Vetoes** |  |  |
| SB 171 | Prohibited firearms at polling places; regulated ghost guns | Objected to ghost gun provisions |
| AB 354 | Strengthened ghost gun regulations | Constitutional concerns |
| AB 355 | Raised age for semi-automatic purchases to 21 | Constitutional concerns; hunting impact |
| **2025 Vetoes** |  |  |
| AB 105 | Prohibited firearms within 100 feet of polling places | Redundant with existing laws |
| AB 245 | Prohibited under-21 from possessing semi-automatic weapons | Overbroad; impacts hunting |
| SB 89 | Prohibited hate crime convicts from possessing firearms | Constitutional concerns |

# **7\. Reform Options Under Debate**

The following options represent the realistic solution space—measures with plausible legislative or regulatory pathways, precedent in other states, and identifiable support coalitions.

## **7.1 Measures Currently Blocked by Vetoes**

### **Raise Purchase Age for Semi-Automatic Weapons to 21**

* **Mechanism:** Align semi-automatic rifle/shotgun purchase age with handgun age (already 21 under federal law)  
* **Supporters:** Gun safety advocates cite data showing 18-20 year-olds commit gun homicides at 3x rate of adults 21+  
* **Opponents:** Gun rights groups argue 18-year-olds have full constitutional rights; impacts young hunters  
* **Feasibility:** Passed legislature twice; requires different governor or veto override

### **Prohibit Firearms at Polling Places**

* **Mechanism:** Extend existing gun-free zone rules (schools, airports, courts) to polling places  
* **Supporters:** Election officials, voter protection groups cite intimidation concerns  
* **Opponents:** Gun rights groups argue existing intimidation laws suffice; infringes on carry rights  
* **Context:** Armed groups gathered outside Las Vegas vote counting site after 2020 election

## **7.2 Potential Future Measures**

### **Waiting Period for Gun Purchases**

* **Current status:** Nevada has no waiting period  
* **Evidence:** Research shows waiting periods reduce gun suicides by allowing "cooling off" period  
* **Support:** 60% of Nevadans favor 30-day waiting period

### **Stronger Safe Storage Requirements**

* **Current status:** Child access prevention law exists but no mandatory safe storage requirement  
* **Evidence:** Secure storage reduces youth gun deaths and injuries by up to 85%  
* **Model:** California, Massachusetts require all unattended firearms to be securely stored

### **Magazine Capacity Limits**

* **Current status:** Nevada has no magazine capacity restrictions  
* **Support:** 60% of Nevadans support ban on high-capacity magazines  
* **Precedent:** 12 states limit magazine capacity (typically 10-15 rounds)  
* **Opposition:** Gun rights groups consider this a core 2nd Amendment infringement
