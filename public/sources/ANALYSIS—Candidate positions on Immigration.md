# Nevada 2026 gubernatorial candidates diverge sharply on immigration

Immigration has emerged as a defining issue in Nevada's 2026 gubernatorial race, with three candidates offering starkly different approaches. Governor Joe Lombardo has systematically expanded state cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, signing the nation's first DOJ agreement to exit the "sanctuary" list. Attorney General Aaron Ford has positioned himself as a constitutional bulwark, publishing model policies limiting local participation in unpaid federal immigration work while defending DACA recipients. Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill has staked out ground opposing National Guard deployments while supporting comprehensive reform—though she remains less prominent in the immigration debate between the two frontrunners.

## Joe Lombardo (R-Incumbent): Escalating federal cooperation

**Position summary:** Governor Lombardo has positioned himself as a strong supporter of federal immigration enforcement, systematically expanding state-ICE cooperation throughout 2025. His trajectory shows significant evolution—from stating mass deportation was "not appropriate policy" in January 2025 to authorizing National Guard support for ICE and signing a DOJ memorandum of understanding by September 2025. His administration quietly ended DACA assistance programs in 2023.

### Direct quotes with sources

**On mass deportation:** "Mass deportations are not what I believe is an appropriate policy... There's a lot of functionality in the immigration space that I'm familiar with due to my experience as the sheriff and the 287(g) programs. That resource is going to take an exorbitant amount of time to deal with."

**On sanctuary policy:** "The Attorney General does not have the authority to make Nevada a sanctuary state or jurisdiction. As long as I am Governor, Nevada will continue to follow federal law."
- *Date:* February 26, 2025 | *Context:* Official statement responding to Ford's model policies | *Source:* Governor's office press release

**On AB 217 veto:** "As written, it applies 24/7, effectively transforming school grounds into sanctuary zones at all times... It creates legal uncertainty, undermines cooperation with federal authorities, and unfairly penalizes school employees caught in the crossfire."
- *Date:* June 5, 2025 | *Context:* Veto message | *Source:* Las Vegas Sun

**On DOJ agreement:** "The State's agreement with the Department of Justice today reaffirms our commitment to following federal immigration law in Nevada."
- *Date:* September 26, 2025 | *Context:* MOU signing announcement | *Source:* Multiple outlets

### Position evolution: Sheriff to Governor

Lombardo's positions have shifted substantially across his career:

- **As Clark County Sheriff (2015-2019):** Maintained 287(g) partnership with ICE but modified policy in December 2018 to stop detaining undocumented individuals with only low-level traffic bench warrants. Tweeted in February 2019: "I was not forced to change the policy. I made the change because it was the right thing to do."

- **Post-court ruling (October 2019):** Suspended official 287(g) program after federal court ruled ICE detainers violated Fourth Amendment. However, implemented alternative policy alerting ICE to release times for nonviolent offenders.

- **2022 campaign:** Emphasized law enforcement credentials; claimed 10,000 deportations during sheriff tenure; called sending National Guard to border "excessively expensive."

- **Early 2025:** Expressed caution on mass deportation; stated "the devil's in the details."

- **Mid-to-late 2025:** Full alignment with Trump administration; authorized National Guard, signed DOJ MOU, approved FEMA funding for ICE infrastructure.

### Gaps in public record

**No documented positions on:**
- Economic impact of enforcement on Nevada's workforce (state has highest undocumented worker share nationally at 9%)
- Legal immigration reform proposals
- Explicit DACA policy statement (only administrative action cutting state support)

**Not publicly released:**
- Comprehensive enforcement statistics under his administration
- Specific National Guard deployment activities and locations
- Total state costs for immigration enforcement cooperation

## Aaron Ford (D-Attorney General): Federal responsibility, constitutional protection

**Position summary:** Attorney General Ford maintains that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that Nevada's resources should not be used for "unpaid federal civil immigration work." He has consistently defended DACA recipients through multistate litigation while publishing model policies clarifying that local entities need not assist with civil immigration enforcement absent judicial warrants. He explicitly denies supporting "sanctuary policies" while opposing what he characterizes as unconstitutional federal mandates.

### Key policy actions with dates

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| March 2017 | Co-sponsored SB 223 (sanctuary state bill) as state senator; later withdrew support |
| October 2019 | Led multistate Supreme Court amicus brief defending DACA |
| November 20, 2024 | Published "Know Your Rights" documents for immigrants and employers |
| January 15, 2025 | Joined 13-state motion to protect DACA healthcare access under ACA |
| January 21, 2025 | Filed lawsuit challenging Trump's birthright citizenship executive order |
| February 24, 2025 | Published 72-page "Model Immigration Policies" document |
| August 18, 2025 | Joined 20-state lawsuit against DOJ over VOCA funding tied to immigration enforcement |
| October 1, 2025 | Filed suit against DOJ to protect VOCA, VAWA, and Byrne JAG funding |

### Model Immigration Policies: Key recommendations

Ford's 72-page document establishes **four guiding principles**: public safety focus, prudent use of public money, prioritizing health/safety/education/justice, and non-discrimination.

**For law enforcement:**
- Officers "will not act as unpaid federal immigration agents"
- Will not ask about citizenship unless tied to criminal investigation
- Will not detain or arrest based on administrative warrants without judicial warrants
- Must distinguish between court-issued criminal warrants and civil administrative notices

**For schools (K-12 and higher education):**
- Notify parents if children interviewed by federal immigration officials
- Staff should not grant consent to immigration officers without proper authorization
- Protect student privacy under FERPA

**For healthcare facilities:**
- Will not disclose patient information unless required by law
- Focus on patient care over immigration enforcement

**Critical clarification:** These policies are nonbinding recommendations, not mandates. Entities may decline adoption if they provide alternative policies to the AG office.

### Position evolution

Ford co-sponsored SB 223 in 2017, a bill limiting state/local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He later withdrew support, stating: "It is not the desire for us to bump heads with the federal government; in that regard, the status quo is a decent process right now."

His current positioning emphasizes compliance with valid judicial warrants while opposing "unpaid" civil immigration enforcement—a strategic moderation from his 2017 stance.

### Gaps in public record

**No documented positions on:**
- Temporary Protected Status (TPS) specifically
- E-Verify requirements
- Legal immigration reform pathways
- Specific stance on local 287(g) agreements beyond general framework
- Formal 2026 gubernatorial campaign immigration platform (positions inferred from AG actions)

## Alexis Hill (D-Washoe County Commissioner): Federal responsibility, comprehensive reform

**Position summary:** Hill's immigration positions, previously undocumented, appear on her official campaign website. She frames border security as a federal responsibility, opposes "costly state-run detention centers," supports comprehensive immigration reform with "fair pathways to citizenship," and explicitly opposes using Nevada's National Guard "to help indiscriminately round up and terrorize our communities." Her positioning aligns more closely with Ford than Lombardo but emphasizes policy solutions over litigation.

### Key policy positions (from campaign website)

**Official statement on immigration:**

> "We need comprehensive immigration laws – and that starts with Congress, not costly state-run detention centers. Border security is a federal responsibility. Nevada should focus on partnering with federal agencies to ensure due process and humane treatment, not building a shadow immigration system in our own backyard. We need comprehensive immigration reform that addresses root causes, creates fair pathways to citizenship, and secures the border effectively. I do not support our Nevada National Guard being used to help indiscriminately round up and terrorize our communities."

### Extracted positions

- **Federal responsibility:** Border security is federal, not state
- **Opposition to state detention centers:** Opposes "costly state-run detention centers" and "shadow immigration system"
- **Due process emphasis:** Supports "due process and humane treatment" for immigrants
- **Comprehensive reform:** Supports reform addressing "root causes" with "fair pathways to citizenship"
- **Border security:** Supports securing the border "effectively"
- **National Guard opposition:** Explicitly opposes Nevada National Guard being used for immigration roundups

### Additional context

On Ford's litigation strategy, Hill stated: "I believe in fighting Trump, but it's more than just filing lawsuits against Trump."
- *Date:* September 5, 2025 | *Context:* Campaign announcement | *Source:* Nevada Current

This suggests Hill supports challenging Trump immigration policies but favors policy-oriented approaches over litigation.

### Washoe County context

- Washoe County Jail has maintained a **30+ year partnership with ICE**
- In August 2025, Washoe County Sheriff's Office received approximately **$430,000** in FEMA/Homeland Security funds to upgrade jail facilities for ICE use
- Protests occurred August 19, 2025 at County Commission meeting regarding ICE cooperation
- **No documented Hill vote on this specific matter**—the ICE jail upgrade was a Sheriff's Office grant processed through state committees, not a County Commission vote
- Washoe County Sheriff does **not** participate in the 287(g) program

### Gaps in public record

**Despite extensive searching, the following could not be confirmed:**
- Any recorded votes on immigration-specific measures at Washoe County Commission
- Public statements specifically about ICE jail upgrade controversy (August 2025)
- Responses to any endorsement questionnaires with immigration questions
- Debate statements comparing her immigration stance to Ford or Lombardo
- Direct statements about sanctuary policies, 287(g) participation, or ICE detainer policies
- Media coverage substantially including Hill in Ford-Lombardo immigration debates

**Note:** Hill launched her gubernatorial campaign in September 2025 and has not been prominently featured in immigration-focused coverage of the race, which has centered on the Ford-Lombardo conflict.

## Research methodology notes

This report applies equal research effort to all three candidates. Positions are distinguished between official statements, documented actions, and claims made by others. Where information gaps exist, they are explicitly noted rather than filled with inference.

**Source evaluation:** Primary sources (official government documents, AG press releases, campaign websites) are prioritized over news coverage. Nevada Independent coverage was found to be thorough and balanced. Partisan advocacy sources were identified and noted where relevant.

**Key finding on Alexis Hill:** The previously identified "critical gap" has been partially filled—Hill does have documented immigration positions on her campaign website. However, she remains substantially less documented than Lombardo and Ford due to limited media coverage and her later campaign entry (September 2025).
