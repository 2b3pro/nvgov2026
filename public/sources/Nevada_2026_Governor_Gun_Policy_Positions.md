# 2026 Nevada Governor Race: Where Candidates Stand on Gun Policy

Only two of five candidates have clear, documented positions on gun policy—and they're diametrically opposed. Governor Joe Lombardo has vetoed every gun safety bill to reach his desk, while Attorney General Aaron Ford has actively defended and implemented Nevada's existing gun laws. The three challengers—Alexis Hill, Irina Hansen, and Matthew Winterhawk—have significant gaps on this defining issue.

This analysis examines positions on background checks, age restrictions, polling place rules, and red flag laws—revealing that gun policy may present voters with the starkest choice in the 2026 race.

## Context: Nevada's Post-2017 Gun Policy Landscape

The 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting—which killed 60 people and remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history—transformed Nevada's gun policy debate. Between 2019 and 2023, under Governor Steve Sisolak (D), Nevada enacted:

- **Universal background checks** (SB 143, 2019)
- **Red flag law** allowing courts to temporarily remove firearms (AB 291, 2019)
- **Bump stock ban** (AB 291, 2019)
- **Child access prevention law** (AB 291, 2019)
- **Ghost gun ban** (AB 286, 2021)

Nevada's gun law grade improved from "F" to "B-" (Giffords Law Center). However, progress has stalled since Governor Lombardo took office in 2023.

**The core tension:** Polling shows 75-83% of Nevadans support key gun safety measures, including majorities of Republicans and gun owners—yet gubernatorial vetoes have blocked implementation.

## Joe Lombardo (R) — Incumbent

**Position: Opposes additional gun regulations**

**Evidence strength: Strong** — Exposed through governing record

### The Veto Record

Lombardo has vetoed **all six gun safety bills** passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature across two sessions:

| Year | Bill | What It Would Have Done | Governor's Rationale |
|------|------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 2023 | SB 171 | Prohibited firearms at polling places; regulated ghost guns | Objected to ghost gun provisions |
| 2023 | AB 354 | Strengthened ghost gun regulations | Constitutional concerns |
| 2023 | AB 355 | Raised age for semi-automatic purchases to 21 | Constitutional concerns; hunting impact |
| 2025 | AB 105 | Prohibited firearms within 100 feet of polling places | Redundant with existing laws |
| 2025 | AB 245 | Prohibited under-21 from possessing semi-automatic weapons | Overbroad; impacts hunting |
| 2025 | SB 89 | Prohibited hate crime convicts from possessing firearms | Constitutional concerns |

### Background and Philosophy

Lombardo's 26-year career with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, including eight years as Clark County Sheriff (2014-2022), shapes his approach. He emphasizes enforcement of existing laws over new restrictions and frames gun regulations as constitutional issues rather than public safety measures.

**Key contradiction:** Lombardo vetoed polling place firearm restrictions citing redundancy with existing intimidation laws—yet armed groups gathered outside the Las Vegas vote-counting facility after the 2020 election, demonstrating gaps in current protections.

### What a Second Term Would Mean

A Lombardo victory would likely mean continued vetoes of gun safety legislation. Democrats lack the two-thirds supermajority needed to override, making the governor's position decisive.

---

## Aaron Ford (D) — Attorney General

**Position: Supports gun safety measures**

**Evidence strength: Strong** — Exposed through AG record and legislative history

### Attorney General Record (2019-Present)

Ford has actively defended and implemented Nevada's gun safety laws:

- **Red flag law training:** Promoted ERPO (Extreme Risk Protection Order) training for law enforcement statewide
- **Ghost gun defense:** Successfully defended AB 286 in court; Nevada Supreme Court upheld the ban in April 2024 (*Sisolak v. Polymer80*)
- **Multi-state coalitions:** Joined litigation efforts supporting gun safety measures
- **Background check implementation:** Oversaw enforcement of universal background check requirements

### Implied Gubernatorial Position

While Ford has not released a detailed gun policy platform for his gubernatorial campaign, his AG record strongly suggests he would sign the measures Lombardo has vetoed, including:

- Raising the semi-automatic purchase age to 21
- Prohibiting firearms at polling places
- Strengthening ghost gun regulations
- Barring hate crime convicts from possessing firearms

### Historical Note

Ford's predecessor, AG Adam Laxalt (R), issued a 2016 opinion declaring the voter-approved universal background check initiative (Question 1) unenforceable—delaying implementation until 2020. Ford's office reversed this posture and actively enforces the law.

## Alexis Hill (D) — Washoe County Commissioner

**Position: Unknown**

**Evidence strength: None** — No documented positions found

### What We Know

Research across campaign materials, news coverage, county commission records, and candidate surveys found **no documented positions** on:

- Universal background checks
- Red flag laws
- Age restrictions for firearm purchases
- Polling place firearm rules
- Assault weapons or magazine capacity limits

### Platform Focus

Hill's campaign emphasizes healthcare (including her flagship Washoe Behavioral Health Center), housing affordability, corporate tax reform, and local government experience. Gun policy is absent from her issue pages.

### What This Means for Voters

Democratic primary voters comparing Ford and Hill cannot evaluate their differences on gun policy based on available evidence. Hill's silence may reflect strategic ambiguity in a swing-county campaign or simply that she hasn't been pressed on the issue.

---

## Irina Hansen (R) — Salon Owner/Real Estate Agent

**Position: Presumed opposition to gun regulations**

**Evidence strength: Weak** — Listed as priority but no specifics documented

### What We Know

Hansen's gubernatorial website includes "Second Amendment" as a policy area, signaling it as a campaign priority. However, research found **no documented positions** on:

- Specific measures Lombardo vetoed
- Background check requirements
- Red flag laws
- Age restrictions

### General Philosophy

Hansen's anti-regulation platform and criticism of government overreach suggest alignment with gun rights positions. During her 2024 Las Vegas mayoral campaign (1.2%, 849 votes), she did not articulate gun policy specifics.

### What This Means for Voters

Republican primary voters cannot evaluate whether Hansen would govern differently than Lombardo on gun issues. Her Second Amendment emphasis without specifics may indicate she would continue or strengthen opposition to new restrictions.

---

## Matthew Winterhawk (R) — SmartSlaps Founder/Author

**Position: Unknown**

**Evidence strength: None** — Gun policy absent from platform

### What We Know

Winterhawk's campaign focuses on government efficiency ("state D.O.G.E."), education reform, and land sovereignty (NLSARA proposal). Gun policy is **entirely absent** from:

- Campaign website
- Ballotpedia candidate survey responses
- News coverage
- Social media presence

### What This Means for Voters

As a self-funded, "zero-dollar" campaign with minimal media coverage, Winterhawk has not been pressed to articulate positions on gun policy or most other issues. Republican primary voters have no basis to compare his approach to Lombardo's.

## Comparative Summary

| Candidate | Party | Position | Evidence | Key Indicator |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Joe Lombardo** | R | Opposes new restrictions | Strong | 6 vetoes (2023-2025) |
| **Aaron Ford** | D | Supports gun safety measures | Strong | AG enforcement record |
| **Alexis Hill** | D | Unknown | None | No documented positions |
| **Irina Hansen** | R | Presumed opposition | Weak | 2A listed, no specifics |
| **Matthew Winterhawk** | R | Unknown | None | Absent from platform |

## The Public Opinion Gap

Polling reveals significant distance between voter preferences and current policy outcomes:

| Policy | Support | Opposition |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Universal background checks | 83% | — |
| Raise semi-auto purchase age to 21 | 77% | — |
| Prohibit guns at polling places | 70% | — |
| Red flag laws | 69% | 17% |
| Ban high-capacity magazines | 60% | 27% |

**Cross-partisan support:** The 21-age-limit measure is supported by 69% of Republicans, 69% of concealed carry permit holders, and 68% of gun owners—yet it has been vetoed twice.

---

## What's at Stake in 2026

The gubernatorial election will determine whether Nevada:

1. **Continues post-2017 reforms** — A Democratic governor (Ford or Hill) would likely sign measures currently blocked by vetoes
2. **Maintains the status quo** — A second Lombardo term means continued vetoes absent a legislative supermajority
3. **Reverses course** — While no candidate has proposed repealing existing laws, enforcement priorities could shift

**Key dates:**
- Primary Election: June 9, 2026
- General Election: November 3, 2026
