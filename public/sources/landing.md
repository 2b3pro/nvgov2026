## Landing Page (Overview & Polling)

- **General Election Poll (Emerson College)** -- **Correction:** The
  site lists an *Emerson College poll from "November 2024" showing
  Lombardo 41% vs. Ford 41%*. In fact, this poll was conducted
  **November 16--18, 2025**, finding Lombardo and Ford tied at 41% with
  \~18%
  undecided[\[1\]](https://emersoncollegepolling.com/nevada-2026-poll/#:~:text=A%20new%20Emerson%20College%20Polling,are%20undecided)[\[2\]](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/governors-race-poll-shows-lombardo-ford-in-virtual-tie-as-both-hit-with-complaints-3584867/#:~:text=Nevada%20voters%20were%20evenly%20split,challenger%20Attorney%20General%20Aaron%20Ford).
  The date reference should be updated to 2025 (the poll post was
  published Nov. 21, 2025).

## Joe Lombardo Page

*(All checked claims appear accurate. No corrective action required.)*

## Aaron Ford Page

- **IRS Tax Liens (\$185K, 2010--2014)** -- **Source Update:** The site
  cites *Washington Free Beacon* for Ford's resolved IRS liens. A more
  neutral source confirms **Ford had IRS liens totaling \~\$185,000 for
  unpaid 2010--2013 taxes**, which were released after
  2014[\[3\]](https://freebeacon.com/politics/doubts-arise-as-to-how-nevada-democrat-incurred-185000-in-unpaid-income-taxes/#:~:text=Ford%2C%20who%20serves%20as%20the,the%20Nevada%20secretary%20of%20state)[\[4\]](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democratic-attorney-general-candidate-aaron-ford-acknowledges-multiple-arrests-as-college-student-in-1990s#:~:text=The%20Las%20Vegas%20Review,payments%2C%20and%20has%20been%20repaid).
  (Ford attributed the debt to recession-era family hardships and has
  since repaid
  it[\[4\]](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/democratic-attorney-general-candidate-aaron-ford-acknowledges-multiple-arrests-as-college-student-in-1990s#:~:text=The%20Las%20Vegas%20Review,payments%2C%20and%20has%20been%20repaid).)
  Replacing the partisan source with reporting by the *Las Vegas
  Review-Journal* or *Nevada Independent* (which reference official
  disclosures) is advised.

- **"From food stamps to five degrees"** -- **Clarification/Source:**
  This biographical claim (Ford's journey from childhood poverty to
  multiple degrees) is a well-documented part of his narrative. A
  *Nevada Independent* profile explicitly notes *"before\... five
  degrees to his name\... there was the Aaron Ford who was on food
  stamps"*, highlighting his humble
  beginnings[\[5\]](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/food-stamps-floor-leader-aaron-fords-rise-senate-pinnacle#:~:text=,AM).
  Adding this reference would strengthen the claim's verification.

- **Trial Lawyers' PAC Influence** -- **Clarification:** The site notes
  Ford's "deep ties to trial lawyers through Citizens for Justice PAC"
  but should explicitly identify this group. *Citizens for Justice* is
  the Nevada Justice Association's PAC (trial lawyers' lobby). It has
  heavily funded Nevada campaigns (e.g. **\$754,000 in 2024 legislative
  races**[\[6\]](https://nevadapoliticaljournal.com/stories/pac-money#:~:text=Democrats%20from%20gaining%20a%20veto,lawyers%E2%80%99%20group%20Citizens%20for%20Justice))
  and even contributed to Lombardo's
  PAC[\[7\]](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-raised-3-2m-in-2024-setting-fundraising-record-2-years-ahead-of-re-election-bid#:~:text=Lombardo%E2%80%99s%20haul%20included%20hundreds%20of,spill%20into%20the%20legislative%20session).
  A clearer source (e.g. *Nevada Independent* report describing Citizens
  for Justice as *"the political arm of a group representing Nevada
  trial
  lawyers"*[\[8\]](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/lombardo-raised-3-2m-in-2024-setting-fundraising-record-2-years-ahead-of-re-election-bid#:~:text=Lombardo%E2%80%99s%20haul%20included%20hundreds%20of,likely%20to%20spill%20into%20the))
  can be cited to substantiate Ford's connection to trial lawyer
  donations.

## Alexis Hill Page

*(All factual claims check out; no outright falsehoods found. Below are
minor source notes for completeness.)*

- **"No subsidies for billionaires" stance** -- Hill's
  anti-corporate-subsidy platform is evidenced in her campaign launch.
  For instance, *Nevada Current* reported Hill vowed to *"end tax
  giveaways to billionaires"* like Tesla's
  deal[\[9\]](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/09/05/hill-promises-tax-reform-end-to-billionaire-giveaways-in-gubernatorial-campaign-announcement/#:~:text=Hill%20promises%20tax%20reform%2C%20end,to%20billionaires%20such%20as).
  Linking this or a similar primary statement would reinforce the claim.

- **Homeless Camping Ban Vote** -- The page correctly states Hill
  **voted in favor of a county camping ban** (March 2024). Official
  records and news confirm the **ordinance passed 3--2 with Hill voting
  "YES"**, even as a Republican member voted "no" on civil-liberties
  grounds[\[10\]](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/washoe-county-prohibits-living-in-vehicle-obstructing-sidewalks-soliciting-on-roadways#:~:text=After%20hours%20of%20public%20comment,the%20amendment%20to%20county%20code).
  No correction needed, but a direct citation (e.g. *Nevada Independent*
  coverage) could be added for transparency.

*(No other candidate pages contained factually disputable claims. All
unlisted claims were verified as accurate and well-sourced.)*
