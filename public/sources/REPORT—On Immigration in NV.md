# Immigration enforcement in Nevada: A systems analysis for voters

Nevada stands at the center of America's immigration debate with the **highest per-capita undocumented workforce in the nation**—roughly 9% of all workers—while simultaneously facing an intensifying federal enforcement campaign and bitter partisan disputes between state leaders. The state's immigrant population of approximately **650,000 people** (one in five residents) contributes an estimated **$20.2 billion annually** to the economy, creating structural tensions between economic dependency and enforcement pressure that will define policy choices for years ahead.

The 2025 escalation of immigration enforcement has transformed Nevada politics. Governor Joe Lombardo signed a first-of-its-kind memorandum with the U.S. Department of Justice removing Nevada from the federal "sanctuary" list, while Attorney General Aaron Ford published model policies encouraging law enforcement to limit ICE cooperation. This executive branch standoff—between two officials expected to face each other in the 2026 gubernatorial race—frames a broader question: how much control do Nevada officials actually have over immigration enforcement in their state?

## Federal authority dominates, but local discretion matters significantly

Immigration enforcement remains fundamentally a federal responsibility under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The landmark *Arizona v. United States* (2012) decision established that states cannot create independent immigration crimes, criminalize unauthorized employment, or authorize warrantless arrests based solely on suspected deportability. However, this same ruling confirmed that states and localities may cooperate with federal enforcement voluntarily.

Three federal agencies operate in Nevada. **ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)**, headquartered in Salt Lake City with a Las Vegas sub-office, conducts arrests and manages deportations across Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Montana. **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)** maintains field offices in Las Vegas and Reno processing immigration benefits. **Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** operates ports of entry at Harry Reid and Reno-Tahoe international airports—Nevada's only federal boundary crossings, as it shares no land border with any foreign country.

Nevada state government has limited direct authority over immigration. Key statutes include **NRS 228.206 and 228.208**, which require the Attorney General to publish non-binding model policies guiding law enforcement interactions with federal immigration authorities. The **Keep Nevada Working Task Force** (NRS 225.520), housed in the Lieutenant Governor's Office, coordinates state workforce strategies inclusive of immigrant populations. Critically, Nevada has neither a sanctuary law limiting ICE cooperation nor a statute authorizing local agencies to enforce civil immigration violations—a legal ambiguity now at the center of active litigation.

Local governments face perhaps the most consequential discretion. Under the 10th Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine, federal authorities cannot compel local cooperation. Each jurisdiction—county sheriff, municipal police department, city jail—sets its own policies on sharing information with ICE, honoring detainer requests, and participating in formal enforcement agreements.

## Four Nevada agencies have signed 287(g) agreements with ICE

The 287(g) program, named for its statutory authorization in the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows ICE to deputize local law enforcement officers to perform limited immigration functions. As of December 2025, four Nevada agencies participate:

| Jurisdiction | Agreement Type | Date Signed | Key Terms |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dept. | Warrant Service Officer | June 2025 | Jail notification only; no field enforcement |
| Douglas County Sheriff's Office | Warrant Service Officer | February 2025 | Jail-based; initially listed as Task Force model in error |
| Mineral County Sheriff's Office | Warrant Service Officer | February 2025 | Pending Task Force application |
| Nye County Sheriff's Office | Warrant Service Officer | Renewed 2020 | Status under review |

The **Las Vegas Metro agreement** represents the most significant policy shift. After suspending its previous 287(g) agreement in October 2019 following federal court rulings questioning detainer constitutionality, Metro signed a new agreement on May 30, 2025—one day after Las Vegas appeared on a Department of Homeland Security "sanctuary jurisdictions" list. The program has expanded dramatically: Metro received **957 ICE detainer requests** through August 2025, compared to just 32 during the same period in 2024.

Under Metro's current policy, officers notify ICE when foreign-born individuals are booked for violent felonies, domestic violence, DUI, burglary, theft, larceny, or assault on law enforcement officers. The 2025 Laken Riley Act expanded notification requirements to include theft-related offenses. However, Metro maintains that officers "will not enforce immigration violations" in the community and will not participate in "mass deportation roundups."

The ACLU of Nevada filed suit in October 2025 (*Morais-Hechavarria v. LVMPD*) challenging Metro's agreement as unauthorized under Nevada's Dillon's Rule doctrine, which holds that local governments possess only those powers explicitly granted by the Legislature. The case could determine whether any Nevada jurisdiction can lawfully participate in 287(g) without legislative authorization.

## Nevada's immigrant population is economically essential and largely long-settled

Nevada's **650,000 foreign-born residents** constitute nearly 20% of the population—substantially higher than the national average of 14.8%. An additional one in six Nevada residents is native-born with at least one immigrant parent, making immigration a generational reality for roughly one-third of all Nevadans.

The undocumented population ranges from **168,000 to 190,000** depending on methodology, with Pew Research Center's 2023 estimate at the higher end. This population is predominantly long-established: **84% have lived in the United States for more than five years**, and 70% have resided here at least a decade. The largest country of origin is Mexico (39%), followed by the Philippines (15%), El Salvador (4%), Cuba (3%), and China (3%).

| Status Category | Estimated Population | Share of Workforce |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Naturalized citizens | 180,000+ | ~11% |
| Lawful permanent residents | ~90,000 | ~5.5% |
| Undocumented/temporary protection | ~110,000 | ~7% |
| DACA recipients | ~11,200 | Included above |
| TPS holders | ~4,000-4,400 | Included above |

DACA recipients in Nevada number approximately **11,200**, with 73% of eligible individuals having applied. Nevada law permits DACA recipients to access in-state tuition, state financial aid (including the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship), professional licensing, and driver's licenses. TPS holders, estimated at 4,000-4,400, are concentrated among Salvadoran and Honduran nationals, with growing Venezuelan populations following recent designations.

## Enforcement has intensified sharply under the current federal administration

ICE arrests in Nevada surged **more than 300%** between January and June 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The Salt Lake City Field Office, covering Nevada, averaged approximately 23 arrests per day in early 2025, with weekly Nevada arrests reaching approximately 48—four times the rate during the Biden administration.

Detention populations have expanded accordingly. The primary facility, **Nevada Southern Detention Center** in Pahrump, held **461 ICE detainees** as of November 2025—nearly double its contracted capacity of 250. Henderson Detention Center held 93 ICE detainees, and Washoe County Jail held 46. Total statewide ICE detention increased by approximately 80% from December 2024 to November 2025. ICE is exploring a "soft-sided" tent facility that could add 450 beds.

The composition of enforcement has also shifted. Approximately **12-14% of arrestees** in Nevada during 2025 had no criminal record. Of those with criminal histories, roughly 70% had non-violent convictions, most commonly traffic-related or drug offenses. Notable operations include a February 2025 joint DEA-ICE action in Reno targeting individuals with deportation orders and criminal histories, and various Las Vegas worksite enforcement actions.

The **Las Vegas Immigration Court**, located at 110 North City Parkway, handles Nevada cases with five immigration judges. Specific current backlog data is unavailable, though national immigration court backlogs exceed 3 million cases. Nevada requires representation for immigration proceedings is not publicly funded—approximately 70% of undocumented minors obtained legal representation, leaving 30% unrepresented.

## Economic stakes are substantial and concentrated in key industries

Immigrants comprise approximately **24% of Nevada's total workforce**—roughly 400,000 workers—with concentration in industries essential to the state economy. The hospitality sector, representing 16.3% of Nevada GDP, depends heavily on immigrant labor: **44.6% of hotel workers** and 74% of housekeepers are foreign-born. Construction, facing documented workforce shortages, employs a 36% immigrant workforce. Landscaping services reach 76% immigrant employment.

| Industry | Immigrant Workforce Share | Economic Significance |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Landscaping services | 76% | Service sector backbone |
| Building services | 61% | Commercial real estate support |
| Hotel services | 43-45% | Core tourism economy |
| Construction | 36% | Housing and development |
| Leisure/hospitality overall | 31% | 16.3% of state GDP |

Economic contributions are quantifiable. Immigrants contribute an estimated **$20.2 billion annually** to Nevada's economy. Tax contributions include **$1.4 billion in state and local taxes** from all immigrants, with undocumented immigrants specifically contributing **$507 million**. Immigrant-led households in Las Vegas hold **$16.6 billion in annual spending power**.

Labor shortages present a parallel concern. According to Associated General Contractors, **79% of Nevada construction companies** report difficulty filling positions. Las Vegas business leaders estimate a shortage exceeding **100,000 construction workers**. The Culinary Workers Union has stated that "this industry cannot function without immigrant workers."

Business ownership data reinforces economic integration: **43,700 immigrant business owners** operate in Nevada, representing 30% of all self-employed residents. Three of Nevada's four Fortune 500 companies—Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts, and Caesars Entertainment—were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants.

## The Lombardo-Ford conflict defines state-level politics

Governor Joe Lombardo, a Republican and former Clark County Sheriff, has positioned Nevada as cooperative with federal immigration enforcement. His key actions include:

- **December 2024**: Signed joint letter with 26 Republican governors pledging support for federal deportation plans
- **June 2025**: Vetoed AB 217, which would have barred immigration officers from school grounds without warrants
- **August 2025**: Authorized Nevada National Guard for "administrative support" of ICE operations
- **September 2025**: Signed MOU with Department of Justice, making Nevada the first state removed from the federal sanctuary list

The MOU commits Nevada to continued use of FEMA funds supporting ICE-law enforcement partnerships and pledges to "counter-balance any actions the Nevada Attorney General and Legislature may take to enact unlawful sanctuary policies."

Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, has pursued a different approach. In February 2025, his office published the **72-page Model Immigration Policies** mandated by AB376 (2021), recommending that law enforcement "limit engagement with federal immigration authorities for enforcement purposes." Ford has emphasized that "immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility" and that his policies aim to "foster community trust."

Ford joined a coalition of 20 state attorneys general suing the Department of Justice over withholding Victims of Crime Act funding from jurisdictions not cooperating with ICE. His office has provided Know Your Rights resources for immigrants while consistently stating: "AG Ford and the Office of the Attorney General do not support sanctuary for any criminal—period."

Both officials are expected to face each other in the 2026 gubernatorial race, ensuring immigration remains central to Nevada politics.

## Local jurisdictions show significant variation in approach

Urban-rural divides characterize local enforcement patterns. Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno) maintain policies limiting cooperation to jail-based notification, while rural counties have more readily embraced 287(g) agreements.

**Las Vegas Metro** maintains a dual posture: participating in 287(g) for specified criminal bookings while refusing community enforcement. Sheriff Kevin McMahill has stated officers "will not stop and question, detain, arrest, or place an immigration hold on any individuals on the grounds they are an undocumented immigrant."

**Henderson Police** reports all undocumented individuals booked to ICE regardless of charges—a broader policy than Metro—while stating it will not assist with deportation operations in the community.

**Washoe County Sheriff** Darin Balaam has maintained since 2015 that the county will not hold individuals solely on ICE detainer requests, citing federal court rulings and liability concerns. However, the county maintains a 30-year partnership providing ICE a detention facility workstation and recently requested $430,000 in FEMA funds for dedicated ICE holding infrastructure.

Rural sheriffs, particularly in Douglas, Mineral, and Lyon counties, have embraced fuller participation. State Senator Robin Titus (R-District 17) has called on all Nevada law enforcement to participate in 287(g), noting with pride that counties in her district lead the state in cooperation.

## Active litigation will shape enforcement boundaries

Three significant cases are proceeding through courts:

**Morais-Hechavarria v. LVMPD** (Clark County District Court, October 2025): The ACLU challenges Metro's 287(g) agreement under Dillon's Rule, arguing local agencies cannot exercise powers not authorized by the Legislature. A ruling against Metro could invalidate 287(g) agreements statewide.

**Garay v. City of Las Vegas & ICE** (U.S. District Court, Nevada): This case challenges ICE detainer practices as Fourth Amendment violations, with plaintiffs arguing detainers exceed the scope authorized under 287(g). The court denied the government's motion to dismiss in December 2025.

**ACLU v. ICE** (U.S. District Court, Nevada, December 2025): A class action challenging mandatory detention policies without bond hearings, with the UNLV Immigration Clinic as co-plaintiff.

These cases address fundamental questions: whether local agencies can participate in immigration enforcement absent explicit legislative authorization, whether ICE detainers comply with constitutional requirements, and what procedural protections detained individuals retain.

## Structural tensions run deeper than partisan disagreement

Several tensions shape Nevada's immigration landscape beyond immediate political conflict:

**Economic necessity versus enforcement pressure**: Nevada's economy structurally depends on immigrant labor, particularly in hospitality and construction. Enforcement actions creating workforce disruptions directly impact the state's economic engine—the Las Vegas tourism industry alone employs a quarter of the state workforce with significant immigrant representation.

**Law enforcement cooperation versus community trust**: Research indicates that immigration enforcement reduces crime reporting in immigrant communities. The Attorney General's Model Policies explicitly cite concerns that "if people in Nevada are afraid to interact with police based on fear of immigration enforcement, then our criminal justice system loses access to witnesses and victims will be deterred from reporting crimes."

**Federal preemption versus state discretion**: While immigration law is federally preempted, states retain significant latitude in choosing cooperation levels. Nevada's current approach—no state mandate either requiring or prohibiting local cooperation—leaves jurisdictions to navigate federal pressure and community concerns individually.

**Border state dynamics**: Though Nevada shares no international border, its proximity to California influences regional patterns. California's comprehensive sanctuary law (SB54) establishes policy contrasts that have made Nevada a target for demonstrating enforcement cooperation.

---

## What different levels of government can actually control

Understanding which officials can affect which outcomes is essential for voters:

**Federal government exclusively controls**: Immigration court decisions, visa and green card processing, DACA and TPS program administration, removal priorities, ICE detention standards, and the fundamental structure of immigration law.

**State officials can influence**: Model policies for local law enforcement, state employment verification requirements beyond federal minimums, access to state benefits and professional licensing, in-state tuition and financial aid eligibility, National Guard deployment for administrative support, and gubernatorial vetoes of protective legislation.

**Local officials control**: Whether to enter 287(g) agreements (subject to pending litigation), policies on honoring ICE detainer requests, information sharing with federal authorities, local jail contracts with ICE, and whether local police assist in immigration operations.

**No level of government currently proposes**: Nevada currently has no pending comprehensive sanctuary legislation, no pending anti-sanctuary legislation mandating cooperation, and no ballot initiatives addressing immigration policy.

## Conclusion: Competing visions with real consequences

Nevada's immigration debate crystallizes competing visions of federalism, community safety, and economic policy. The state's unusually high reliance on immigrant labor—nearly one in ten workers is undocumented—creates economic stakes that distinguish Nevada from less immigrant-dependent states.

For voters, several questions merit consideration: Should local law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities, and if so, to what degree? Should the Legislature clarify whether local 287(g) agreements require authorization? How should policymakers balance enforcement with community trust and economic needs?

The Lombardo-Ford dispute ensures these questions will remain politically central. Pending litigation may resolve legal ambiguities about local enforcement authority. But the underlying tensions—between federal mandate and local discretion, between enforcement and economic integration, between security concerns and community trust—will persist regardless of which party prevails in specific elections.

Nevada's immigrant population has deep roots: four in five undocumented residents have lived in the United States for more than five years. Whatever enforcement policies emerge, they will affect long-established residents, mixed-status families, essential workers, and tax-paying business owners who constitute a significant share of the state's human and economic capital.
