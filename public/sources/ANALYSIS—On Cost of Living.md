# Nevada 2026 gubernatorial race: Where candidates stand on cost of living

**Nevada voters face a critical choice in 2026 as cost-of-living pressures persist across utilities, childcare, and wages.** This nonpartisan research reveals stark contrasts among the five declared candidates—with the two major-party frontrunners offering detailed but divergent records while the three challengers have articulated few specific positions on these kitchen-table issues. Governor Joe Lombardo's governing record prioritizes business-friendly policies and fiscal restraint, while Attorney General Aaron Ford has championed consumer protection and wage increases. Among Democrats, Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill has outlined aggressive tax reform proposals targeting corporations. Republican challengers Irina Hansen and Matthew Winterhawk have not publicly addressed utilities, childcare, or minimum wage despite declaring their candidacies.

## Nevada's affordability crisis provides essential context

Nevada residents confront significant cost pressures that make gubernatorial policy positions particularly consequential. Understanding the current landscape helps contextualize candidate proposals.

**Utility costs spiked then stabilized.** NV Energy customers experienced "the highest bills in the last decade" in 2023, driven by natural gas price volatility passed through quarterly fuel adjustments. Southern Nevada bills were projected down **19%** from late 2023 to late 2024 as natural gas prices fell 36%. However, NV Energy's proposed tripling of Northern Nevada's basic service charge from $16.50 to **$45.30** monthly—which would be the highest among investor-owned utilities nationally—remains under regulatory review. Nearly **32,000 Nevadans** had power disconnected for nonpayment in 2024, underscoring continued affordability challenges.

**Childcare costs burden working families.** Nevada ranks as the **4th least affordable state** for childcare according to WalletHub analysis, with every county qualifying as a childcare desert due to insufficient licensed capacity. Median married couples with children spend **11% of income** on care—above the 7% federal affordability threshold—while single mothers in Clark County spend an average of **42%**. The state's childcare subsidy program began cutting approximately 5,500 children from rolls in early 2025 as federal COVID-era funding expired.

**Minimum wage reached $12 but future increases uncertain.** Nevada's minimum wage reached **$12.00 per hour** on July 1, 2024, following the 2022 passage of Ballot Question 2. Unlike some states, Nevada eliminated its tip credit—tipped employees receive the full minimum. However, the wage is **not indexed to inflation**, meaning future increases require legislative action. MIT's Living Wage Calculator estimates $24.10/hour is necessary for a single adult in Las Vegas to remain above poverty, indicating the gap between minimum and living wages.

## Joe Lombardo: Business-friendly executive with extensive veto record

Governor Joe Lombardo's cost-of-living record can be evaluated through executive actions rather than statements alone. The former Clark County Sheriff took office January 2023 and officially launched his re-election campaign September 15, 2025. His tenure includes a record **162 vetoes**—the most by any Nevada governor in a single term.

### Utilities: Signed refund bill, appointed industry-connected officials

Lombardo signed **AB452 (2025)**, requiring utility customer refunds when billing mistakes occur. The Nevada Conservation League praised the bill as shifting "responsibility for skyrocketing fuel costs away from hardworking Nevadans and back to the utility." He also signed **SB417 (2025)**, allowing Southwest Gas to pursue alternative ratemaking—criticized by consumer advocates as potentially harmful to ratepayers.

His March 2023 Executive Order called for a "balanced approach to energy use and development" emphasizing both renewable and fossil fuel sources. He withdrew Nevada from the U.S. Climate Alliance in July 2023, stating the alliance goals "conflict with the energy policy objectives" in his executive order. His appointees include Dwayne McClinton, a former Southwest Gas lobbyist, as Director of the Governor's Office of Energy, and Randy Brown to the Public Utilities Commission, who amended an order requiring ratepayers to cover $5.75 million in NV Energy employee bonuses despite incomplete performance targets.

**Evidence confidence: Strong** — Multiple executive actions, signed bills, and appointee decisions documented.

### Childcare: Proposed tax credits that failed; vetoed related bills

In his 2025 State of the State address, Lombardo stated: "Targeted tax credits for child care facilities, for example, help working families but also support businesses in building a stronger, more inclusive workforce." His economic development bill **SB461** included up to **$12 million annually** in tax credits for building childcare facilities, but it failed to advance in the legislature.

Lombardo vetoed **AB185 (2025)**, which would have prohibited HOAs from banning licensed home-based childcare. His veto message acknowledged "expanding access to child care is an important goal" but stated the bill would "erode the integrity of HOA governance." He also vetoed **AB388**, the paid family and medical leave bill, citing "broad, burdensome mandates" contradicting Nevada's "business-friendly environment."

The state's Child Care Development Program is cutting approximately 5,500 children from subsidy rolls as federal funding expires—a consequence of funding timelines rather than state policy decisions, though the administration has not proposed replacement funding.

**Evidence confidence: Moderate** — Clear veto record and proposed tax credits documented, but major proposal did not advance.

### Minimum wage: No direct statements found

Research found **no direct public statements** from Lombardo on Nevada's $12/hour minimum wage or potential further increases. Labor advocates have expressed concern that he "could easily block any proposed increase" based on his veto record. His vetoes of worker protection legislation and repeated emphasis on maintaining Nevada's "business-friendly environment" suggest opposition to mandated wage increases, though this is inferential rather than stated.

**Evidence confidence: Limited** — Position inferred from business-friendly philosophy and veto patterns.

## Aaron Ford: Consumer protection advocate with legislative wage record

Attorney General Aaron Ford declared his gubernatorial candidacy July 28, 2025. His record spans both executive action (2019-present as AG) and legislative voting (2013-2018 as State Senator, including tenure as Majority Leader). His personal biography—a single father who used food stamps, Medicaid, and Section 8 housing during college—features prominently in his campaign messaging.

### Utilities: Active AG intervention against rate increases

Ford's Bureau of Consumer Protection has taken significant action on utility issues. In October 2025, the Bureau called NV Energy's mandatory demand charge **"unlawful"** and filed a petition to reverse the PUCN decision, stating it "violates Nevada law which prohibits mandatory time-of-use rates for all customers." After the PUCN denied reconsideration, Ford's office filed a judicial review petition in Clark County court.

The AG's office has demanded NV Energy "account for every cent it has overcharged ratepayers from 2001 to 2025" related to customer misclassification. In December 2025, Ford joined 22 other state attorneys general in suing the EPA to recover **$155.7 million** in federal Solar For All grants terminated by the Trump administration, stating: "The president would see Nevadans left high and dry after they committed time and resources to make our state a model of solar energy."

Ford's campaign framing: "I believe parents shouldn't have to choose between keeping the lights on and putting food on the table."

**Evidence confidence: Strong** — Multiple AG office actions and court filings documented.

### Childcare: 2017 legislative priority, limited current specifics

As Senate Majority Leader in 2017, Ford championed the "Nevada Blueprint" Democratic legislative agenda, which included "affordable childcare" as a core priority with a specific proposal to "offer tax credits to employers who provide or help their employees cover childcare costs." The Blueprint framed childcare alongside "women's pay equality" and "affordable college" as economic priorities.

His 2026 campaign has referenced universal school meals and his personal experience—"When I became a dad during college — and then a single dad — Medicaid helped me and my son see a doctor. Food stamps helped keep us fed"—but no detailed childcare policy platform has been articulated. No specific position on pre-K expansion was found.

**Evidence confidence: Moderate** — 2017 legislative record establishes priority; current campaign specifics limited.

### Minimum wage: Led legislative effort to establish current structure

Ford has the clearest documented minimum wage record among all candidates. As Senate Majority Leader, he was the **lead sponsor of SB 106 (2017)**, which would have raised Nevada's minimum wage to $12/hour incrementally. When the bill faced opposition from Governor Sandoval, Ford stated: "Of course, we'd be disappointed if we weren't able to start raising the minimum wage next year, but that's why we've left open the option of pursuing a constitutional amendment. If Nevada Republicans won't consider giving working families a raise, then Nevada voters will."

Ford argued: "Gradually increasing the minimum wage will put hundreds of millions into the pockets of Nevadans who then will spend money on basic necessities." He also supported the constitutional amendment approach (SJR 6) that ultimately led to the 2018/2020 ballot measure establishing the current $12/hour rate.

His 2026 campaign has stated government "should work to ensure that jobs pay enough to live well — with benefits, dignity and a path to stability," but has not explicitly addressed whether $12/hour is sufficient or whether he supports further increases.

**Evidence confidence: Strong** — Clear legislative record as wage-increase champion.

## Alexis Hill: Progressive tax reformer with county government record

Washoe County Commission Chair Alexis Hill announced her gubernatorial campaign September 4, 2025. A former city planner representing Incline Village/Crystal Bay since 2020, Hill has articulated the most detailed progressive policy platform among declared candidates, centered on her signature proposal to eliminate corporate subsidies.

### Utilities: Limited record despite sustainability focus

Hill was appointed to the Truckee Meadows Water Authority board in January 2021, providing some water policy experience. Her official biography emphasizes she is "passionate about conservation and smart growth policies; fighting climate change on a local level" and helped bring a sustainability manager to Washoe County.

However, research found **no direct statements** on NV Energy rates, renewable energy mandates, fuel cost pass-throughs, or utility assistance programs. Her campaign mentions infrastructure funding tied to inflation and usage but does not address utility affordability specifically.

**Evidence confidence: Limited** — Water policy board experience documented; no NV Energy or electric rate positions found.

### Childcare: Explicit priority with universal pre-K support

Hill's campaign website explicitly states: "**Affordable childcare:** Nevada has the most expensive childcare in the nation. We need to streamline permitting processes and remove excessive red tape for childcare providers."

In a KTNV interview, she elaborated: "We can actually create our own jobs with public works projects, where we can ensure that there's livable wages with these projects. We can build new schools in Las Vegas, we can build new roads, we can invest in affordable housing and workforce housing. **We can invest in child care centers.** That is the kind of investment I want to see in Nevada."

Her platform includes explicit support for **universal pre-K**: "Studies show universal pre-kindergarten improves academic outcomes and leads to health and economic benefits for enrolled families. We must ensure permanent funding of universal pre-K for all Nevada children." She also supports free school breakfast and lunch programs.

**Evidence confidence: Strong** — Multiple direct quotes and detailed campaign platform positions.

### Minimum wage: Pro-union stance without specific dollar amount

Hill has not articulated a specific position on Nevada's $12/hour minimum wage or further increases. Her platform emphasizes "livable wages" language: "Support unions and livable wages and end freeloading off of workers - Unions are the backbone of Nevada's workforce and critical to ensuring livable wages and fair benefits."

Her distinctive labor position is opposition to Nevada's right-to-work law, which she calls "Right to Freeload": "This law means that some workers pay for things that benefit all workers – like if only some people paid HOA dues, but they still got access to all the benefits. This is wrong." She advocates removing opt-out options on union dues for employees in unionized workplaces.

**Evidence confidence: Limited** — Strong pro-union and "livable wage" philosophy documented; no specific wage rate position found.

### Economic philosophy: "No subsidies for billionaires"

Hill's signature proposal would eliminate corporate tax incentives: "Tax giveaways like what the State Legislature gave to Elon Musk to bring Tesla to Washoe County do not work, and as your governor, I will work to dismantle those." She frames this as redirecting funds to Nevadans: "I believe that we need to invest in Nevadans and actually tax billionaires and corporations who are doing business in our community who are getting a free pass."

Her property tax reform proposal would reset depreciation every time a property sells and tax corporate-owned residential properties as investments. A similar proposal in the 2025 legislative session was projected to generate hundreds of millions annually for education but died in the Senate. She supports **$2.5 billion in additional annual education spending** over 10 years and temporary rent caps as a short-term measure.

## Irina Hansen: Small business perspective with no specific cost-of-living positions

Irina Hansen, a salon owner and real estate agent who ran unsuccessfully for Las Vegas mayor in 2024, is challenging Governor Lombardo in the Republican primary. Research found **no documented positions** on utilities, childcare, or minimum wage despite her declared candidacy.

### Background and economic philosophy

Born in Communist Romania, Hansen immigrated to the United States and built a career in real estate (21+ years) and founded Prestige Salon and Spa in 2019. Her campaign centers on anti-regulation themes drawn from personal experience: "And then the government of Nevada, the very system meant to protect small business owners like me, came in and destroyed everything I built. They didn't just go after my business… they came after my ability to provide for my family."

During her mayoral campaign, she stated: "The city lures big businesses with incentives, including tax breaks. We don't do that for small business owners." Her gubernatorial website lists policy sections on education, affordable housing, Second Amendment, judicial reform, veterans, election integrity, and sanctuary policies—but no visible energy or utilities page.

### Position gaps on cost-of-living issues

Despite thorough research across multiple sources including campaign websites, news coverage, and social media:

- **Utilities**: No statements found on rates, regulation, or energy policy
- **Childcare**: No policy positions found; personal narrative references being a single mother but does not address childcare policy
- **Minimum wage**: No statements found on wage levels, labor costs, or regulation

Hansen did not complete Ballotpedia's Candidate Connection survey, which would have provided detailed policy positions. Her 2024 mayoral primary campaign received approximately 1% of votes.

**Evidence confidence: No evidence** on all three specific issues; **moderate evidence** on general anti-regulation philosophy.

---

## Matthew Winterhawk: Government efficiency focus with undefined cost-of-living positions

Matthew Winterhawk, a Las Vegas small business owner and nonprofit founder running a self-described "zero-dollar, no-donors campaign," is also challenging Lombardo in the Republican primary. Research found **no documented positions** on utilities, childcare, or minimum wage.

### Background and signature proposals

Winterhawk is co-founder of SmartSlaps Foundation, an education nonprofit, and operates Wujia RA Limited, a family music and media label. He has no prior elected office and has received minimal coverage from major Nevada news outlets. He is described as "not polling significantly" by nonpartisan analysts.

His platform emphasizes two major proposals:

**Department of Government Efficiency**: "I will create the Department of Government Efficiency on Day One, so Nevadans know exactly where their tax dollars go." The proposal includes "public dashboards" for spending transparency and post-session audit orders.

**NLSARA (Nevada Land Sovereignty and Reclamation Act)**: A proposed ballot initiative to reclaim state control of federal lands (approximately 80% of Nevada). This would keep "resource leases, grazing fees, and mineral rights revenue" in Nevada. This is distinct from cost-of-living policy.

### Position gaps on cost-of-living issues

Despite thorough research:

- **Utilities**: No statements found on rates, NV Energy, or energy policy
- **Childcare**: No positions found; homeschools his own children but has not addressed childcare policy
- **Minimum wage**: No statements found despite "economic freedom" messaging

His general tax philosophy suggests shifting burden from "everyday Nevadans" to "high-profit industries" and tourism, but no specific wage or service cost policies have been articulated.

**Evidence confidence: No evidence** on all three specific issues; **strong evidence** on government efficiency and land sovereignty proposals.

## Comparative analysis reveals clear contrasts and significant gaps

The five declared candidates offer markedly different approaches—and markedly different levels of policy specificity—on cost-of-living issues. The comparison table below summarizes documented positions:

| Candidate | Party | Utilities | Childcare | Minimum Wage |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Joe Lombardo** | R-Incumbent | Signed utility refund bill (AB452); "balanced" energy approach; industry-connected appointees | Proposed $12M tax credits (failed); vetoed HOA childcare bill; vetoed paid leave | No direct statements; "business-friendly" philosophy suggests opposition to increases |
| **Aaron Ford** | D | AG actions calling NV Energy demand charge "unlawful"; sued to protect solar funds | 2017 legislative champion of employer childcare tax credits; no detailed 2026 platform | Led 2017 effort to raise to $12; pro-increase rhetoric; unclear on further increases |
| **Alexis Hill** | D | TMWA board member; sustainability focus; no NV Energy statements | "Most expensive in nation"; streamline permits; universal pre-K support | No specific position; "livable wages" language; pro-union |
| **Irina Hansen** | R | No position found | No position found | No position found |
| **Matthew Winterhawk** | R | No position found | No position found | No position found |

### Key differentiators between candidates

**Consumer protection approach**: Ford has actively used AG powers to challenge utility rate structures and pursued legal action against NV Energy. Lombardo's appointees have generally favored utility interests, though he signed the utility refund bill.

**Childcare philosophy**: Lombardo favors tax credits for facility construction; Hill supports direct government investment in childcare centers and universal pre-K; Ford championed employer tax credits in 2017 but lacks current specifics.

**Economic framing**: Lombardo emphasizes fiscal restraint and business-friendly environment ("no new taxes," 162 vetoes); Hill emphasizes corporate accountability and ending subsidies for "billionaires"; Ford emphasizes consumer protection and fighting "special interests."

**Republican primary contrast**: Hansen and Winterhawk have not differentiated themselves from Lombardo on cost-of-living issues through specific policy positions.

### Areas of notable silence

Several significant gaps exist in the candidate field's documented positions:

- **No candidate** has explicitly stated whether Nevada's $12/hour minimum wage is sufficient or should be increased
- **Only Hill** has articulated a specific position on universal pre-K
- **Neither Hansen nor Winterhawk** has addressed any of the three core cost-of-living issues despite being declared candidates
- **Specific utility rate reform** positions beyond general consumer protection are limited across all candidates

## Conclusion: Evidence-based voting requires continued scrutiny

This research confirms that **Lombardo and Ford offer the most complete—and most contrasting—records** on cost-of-living issues. Lombardo's governing record demonstrates consistent business-friendly priorities through vetoes and appointees, while Ford's AG tenure shows active consumer protection intervention. Hill has articulated progressive proposals on childcare and corporate taxation but lacks depth on utilities and wages.

The three Republican candidates present distinct profiles: Lombardo governs from the center-right with industry connections; Hansen campaigns on anti-regulation sentiment without policy specifics; Winterhawk focuses on government efficiency and land sovereignty unrelated to daily living costs.

For Nevada voters prioritizing cost-of-living issues, **significant research gaps remain**. As campaigns develop through 2026, voters should seek candidate responses on: (1) whether $12/hour minimum wage is adequate and what changes, if any, they support; (2) specific positions on NV Energy rate structures and PUCN oversight; and (3) funding mechanisms for childcare expansion beyond general statements of support.

The evidence base for Hansen and Winterhawk is insufficient for meaningful comparison on these issues—a notable finding given that both have declared gubernatorial candidacies. Voters in the Republican primary face particular uncertainty about challenger positions relative to the incumbent.
