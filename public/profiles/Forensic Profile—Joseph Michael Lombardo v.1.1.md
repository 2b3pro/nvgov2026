# **Forensic Profile: Joseph Michael Lombardo**

## **I. Executive Orientation**

### **1.1 Strategic Context and Report Scope**

This dossier constitutes a forensic investigation into the governance, political identity, and influence networks of Joseph Michael Lombardo, the 31st Governor of Nevada. Elected in 2022 as the only Republican challenger to unseat a sitting Democratic governor in that cycle, Lombardo occupies a distinct and volatile position within the American political landscape. He governs a state that functions as a quintessential bellwether—a "purple" jurisdiction with a Democratic-controlled legislature, a powerful hospitality-industrial complex, and a demographic composition that often presages national trends.

The investigation leverages a forensic methodology, triangulating biographical data, financial disclosures, legislative records, and court filings to construct a conflict-mapped profile. Unlike standard political biographies, this report treats governance as a function of incentive structures. It posits that Lombardo’s executive actions are best understood not merely as ideological expressions, but as the output of a specific coalition of interests: the law enforcement apparatus from which he emerged, and the high-capital real estate and gaming sectors that financed his ascent.

### **1.2 The "Veto Governor" Paradigm**

The defining characteristic of the Lombardo administration's first term (2023–2025) is the aggressive weaponization of the executive veto. Operating against a Democratic legislative majority that fell just one vote short of a supermajority in the Senate, Lombardo has established a governance model of negation. He issued 75 vetoes in the 2023 session and broke his own record with 87 vetoes in the 2025 session.1

This pattern reveals a strategic calculus: Lombardo has largely abandoned the attempt to shape social policy through legislative negotiation, preferring to act as a hard firewall against the progressive agenda of the legislature. This "Veto Governor" posture serves a dual purpose. Functionally, it halts the expansion of the social safety net, tenant protections, and gun control measures. Politically, it allows him to perform "conservatism" for his base without needing to pass a radical conservative agenda that might alienate the state's moderate median voter.

### **1.3 Core Forensic Findings**

The investigation has isolated four primary structural dynamics defining the Lombardo governorship:

1. **The Real Estate Capture:** A high-fidelity correlation exists between the administration's housing policy and the financial interests of its largest donor, Robert Bigelow. Bigelow, a hotel magnate and landlord, contributed over $25 million to Lombardo's election efforts.3 In return, Lombardo has systematically vetoed tenant protection bills, rent stabilization measures, and eviction reforms, and appointed a former corporate housing lobbyist, Ryan Cherry, as his Chief of Staff.4 This represents a quintessential example of regulatory capture.  
2. **Corporate Statism ("The Nevada Way"):** While maintaining a fiscal conservative posture on social welfare, Lombardo has aggressively championed state intervention in the economy when it benefits corporate capital. This is evidenced by his signature on the $380 million public financing deal for the Oakland Athletics stadium and the $330 million tax abatement for Tesla.6 This ideological flexibility—statist for corporations, libertarian for the poor—is branded as "The Nevada Way."  
3. **The Law Enforcement Shield:** Lombardo leverages his 26-year tenure with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) as his primary credential and moral shield. However, forensic analysis of his time as Sheriff reveals a department that paid out nearly $19 million in civil rights settlements in a single reporting period and struggled with transparency following the 1 October mass shooting.8 He continues to use his "lawman" persona to justify expanding the carceral state, notably through the revival of the Resort Corridor Court.10  
4. **Dark Money Innovation:** The administration has demonstrated sophistication in financial opacity. The conversion of his "Inaugural Committee" into the "Service First Fund"—a 501(c)(4) dark money group used to attack political opponents—represents a degradation of Nevada’s campaign finance norms and a deliberate evasion of donor disclosure.11

**II. Biography & Formative Influences**

### **2.1 Origins and the Military Imprint**

Joseph Lombardo’s worldview is rooted in the hierarchical structures of the military and the chain-of-command discipline of law enforcement. Born in Sapporo, Japan, on November 8, 1962, to a U.S. Air Force veteran father, Lombardo experienced a transient childhood typical of military dependents before his family established roots in Las Vegas in 1976\.13

This upbringing in a regimented environment was not merely incidental; it was formative. Immediately upon graduating from Rancho High School in 1980, Lombardo enlisted in the United States Army. He served from 1980 to 1986, including stints in the Nevada National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve.13 This six-year immersion in military culture instilled a deferential respect for institutional authority and a top-down leadership style that would later characterize his tenure as Sheriff and Governor. The "mission-first" ethos of the military often translates in civilian governance to a preference for operational efficiency over democratic deliberation, a tendency visible in his frustration with legislative gridlock.

### **2.2 Academic and Technocratic Pedigree**

Unlike many law enforcement officials who pursue degrees in criminal justice, Lombardo holds a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), earned after his military service. He later acquired a Master of Science in Crisis Management from UNLV and completed the 227th Session of the FBI National Academy in 2006\.13

This engineering background is a critical, often overlooked forensic detail. It suggests a mind trained in structural mechanics, systems analysis, and concrete problem-solving rather than abstract political theory. As Assistant Sheriff, Lombardo was placed in charge of the technical services division, overseeing radio systems and information technology.13 This technocratic competence was central to his rise, positioning him as a modernizer within the force. However, it also creates a stark contrast with his administration's struggle to manage the massive 2025 cyberattack on state systems, a failure of the very technical infrastructure he once supervised.16

### **2.3 The Law Enforcement Ascension (1988–2022)**

Lombardo joined the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) as an officer in 1988\. His 26-year climb through the ranks was methodical:

* **1996:** Sergeant.  
* **2001:** Lieutenant.  
* **2006:** Captain.  
* **2011:** Assistant Sheriff.  
* **2014:** Elected Sheriff of Clark County.  
* **2018:** Re-elected Sheriff.17

As Sheriff, Lombardo was not just a police chief but the CEO of the state's largest political subdivision, managing a massive budget and navigating the complex politics of Clark County. His tenure was defined by the balance between aggressive policing and community relations in a minority-majority city.

**The 1 October Crucible:** The mass shooting on October 1, 2017, at the Route 91 Harvest Festival was the defining moment of his shrievalty. Lombardo became the global face of the response. While initially praised for his calm demeanor, the investigation faced intense scrutiny for changing timelines and the ultimate conclusion that the shooter, Stephen Paddock, acted alone with no determineable motive.18 The handling of the aftermath—defending the department against negligence claims while his officers faced trauma—forged a "bunker mentality" that persists in his governorship. He learned to manage the media through controlled releases and to align closely with the gaming industry, whose liability concerns mirrored the department's reputational risks.20

**Civil Rights Record:** Under Lombardo's command, LVMPD's record was mixed. While he implemented some reforms, the department remained a high-liability entity. In a single year reported during his transition to Governor, the department paid out nearly $19 million in legal claims, including settlements for excessive force and ADA violations in detention centers.8 This high cost of policing suggests a tolerance for aggressive tactics that prioritized control over civil liberties, a philosophy he has carried into the Governor's mansion through his support for the Resort Corridor Court.

**III. Political Identity & Belief System**

### **3.1 The "Pragmatic Authoritarian"**

Lombardo’s political identity is often miscategorized as simply "moderate" due to his distance from the most performative aspects of the MAGA movement. A more accurate forensic classification is **Pragmatic Authoritarian**. He is transactional and flexible on social issues when necessary for electoral survival (Pragmatic) but rigid and punitive on issues of public order, transparency, and executive power (Authoritarian).

This duality allows him to navigate Nevada's purple terrain. He can sign a bill protecting abortion rights (appealing to the suburban middle) while simultaneously vetoing bills that would restrict firearm access or expand voting rights (appealing to the conservative base).

### **3.2 Ideological Mapping Matrix**

| Domain | Stated Belief | Forensic Reality / Policy Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Social / Cultural** | "Pro-Life"; "Anti-Woke" | **Transactional:** Signed SB131 codifying abortion protections.22 Vetoed transgender health protections and gender-affirming care shield laws.23 Targets vulnerable minorities (transgender individuals) where political cost is lower, while protecting broad rights (abortion) that have majority support. |
| **Economic** | "Free Market"; "Low Tax" | **Corporate Statist:** Supports massive public subsidies for private enterprise (A's Stadium, Tesla).6 Vetoed rent control and anti-price gouging measures for consumers.24 His "free market" applies to labor and tenants, not capital. |
| **Public Safety** | "Law and Order" | **Selective Enforcement:** Advocates for strict policing of street crime (Resort Corridor Court) but sought to evade consequences for his own ethics violations ("Badge Gate").25 Vetoed gun safety measures despite police union support for some regulations.26 |
| **Governance** | "Transparency" | **Opaque:** Created dark money vehicles for inaugural funds.11 Fought public records requests for emails.27 Centralizes control and limits press access. |

### **3.3 "The Nevada Way"**

Lombardo has branded his governing philosophy as "The Nevada Way." In his State of the State addresses, he defines this as a spirit of independence, resilience, and economic diversification.28 Rhetorically, it is used to justify a lack of regulation. Functionally, "The Nevada Way" serves as a euphemism for a business-friendly environment where the state government acts as a partner to major industries (mining, gaming, logistics) rather than a regulator. It prioritizes economic metrics (GDP, job creation) over social metrics (housing affordability, education equity).

### **3.4 The Trump Factor**

Lombardo's relationship with Donald Trump is calculated. He accepted Trump's endorsement in the primary to secure the base 29 and has appeared at rallies. However, he carefully avoids the most radioactive elements of election denialism. He acknowledges the legitimacy of the 2020 election implicitly by governing within the system, yet he vetoes election administration bills (like ballot drop box expansion) to signal alignment with the "election integrity" movement.1 This is a "soft MAGA" approach: adopting the policy aims (border security, voting restrictions) without fully embracing the destabilizing rhetoric.

## ---

**IV. Voting Record / Policy Record**

### **4.1 The Veto as Governance Strategy**

Lombardo’s legislative record is defined less by what he passed and more by what he stopped. His record-breaking use of the veto (162 total across two sessions) reveals a systematic rejection of the Democratic platform.

Housing and Tenant Rights (The Bigelow Vetoes):  
The most consequential use of the veto power occurred in the housing sector. Lombardo vetoed:

* **AB486 Extension:** A measure to prevent evictions for tenants with pending rental assistance applications.30  
* **SB335:** Legislation to stay evictions and reform the summary eviction process.5  
* **AB44:** A bill prohibiting price gouging on essential goods, including housing.24  
* **Corporate Homeownership Bill:** In the 2025 special session, a bipartisan attempt to limit corporate purchase of single-family homes was killed, with Lombardo’s opposition playing a key role.31

*Forensic Note:* These vetoes directly preserve the leverage of landlords and corporate property owners in a state with a severe housing crisis. They align perfectly with the interests of Robert Bigelow, his largest donor.32

Gun Control:  
Lombardo vetoed three major gun safety bills in 2023 and again in 2025, despite polling showing 70% public support for some measures 26:

* **AB105:** Prohibited firearms at polling places. Lombardo argued it was "duplicative" of existing voter intimidation laws, ignoring the specific threat of armed presence at polls.33  
* **AB245:** Raised the age to possess semi-automatic weapons to 21\.  
* **SB89:** Prohibited possession by those convicted of hate crimes.

**Civil Rights & Social Policy:**

* **Transgender Rights:** Vetoed bills protecting gender-affirming care providers from out-of-state prosecution and shielding patient data. He cited "critical ambiguity" and "subjective interpretation," effectively refusing to make Nevada a sanctuary for trans healthcare.23  
* **Voting Rights:** Vetoed AB534 (election omnibus) and SB443 (voter registration), citing concerns about "election integrity" and the centralization of power in the Secretary of State's office.1

### **4.2 Legislative Achievements (The "Yes" Votes)**

When Lombardo signs legislation, it is almost exclusively focused on economic development through subsidy or public safety expansion.

The Oakland A's Stadium Deal (SB1):  
Lombardo signed a $380 million public financing package to relocate the Oakland Athletics to Las Vegas.

* **Mechanism:** Transferable tax credits and county bonds.  
* **Context:** This was opposed by the "Schools Over Stadiums" coalition, who argued the money should fund Nevada's underperforming schools (ranked 48th in per-pupil funding).6  
* **Beneficiaries:** The deal benefits the construction unions, the A's ownership (John Fisher), and the surrounding Strip resorts (MGM, Caesars) who gain a new attraction. It exemplifies Lombardo's prioritization of tourism infrastructure over social infrastructure.

The Tesla Tax Abatement:  
Lombardo approved $330 million in tax breaks for Tesla’s expansion in Northern Nevada.7 This continuation of the Gigafactory incentives cements Nevada’s status as a tax haven for large manufacturers, placing the tax burden on residents and smaller businesses.  
Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act:  
Signed in 2025, this omnibus crime bill revived the Resort Corridor Court.

* **Function:** A specialized court for crimes committed on the Las Vegas Strip.  
* **Controversy:** It allows for "Order Out" provisions, effectively banning individuals from the tourist corridor for up to a year. Civil rights groups (ACLU) argue this criminalizes homelessness and violates the right to travel and assembly.35  
* **Strategic Intent:** This effectively privatizes the public streets of the Strip, turning state judicial power into a security service for the casinos.

Education Compromise:  
While failing to pass his desired expansive school choice vouchers, Lombardo did sign a historic $2 billion increase in K-12 funding in 2023 (SB500) and later secured $38 million for charter school teacher raises (AB398).37 This reflects a pragmatic acceptance that he cannot starve the public school system without political backlash, even as he tries to nurture a parallel charter system.

## ---

**V. Financial, Business, & Donor Networks**

### **5.1 The Bigelow Dependency: A $50 Million Shadow**

Forensic analysis of campaign finance records reveals that Lombardo’s governorship is heavily underwritten by a single source: Robert Bigelow.

* **The Numbers:** Bigelow donated over **$25 million** to pro-Lombardo PACs in the 2022 cycle alone. Across all recipients, his spending exceeded $47 million.3  
* **The Nexus:** Bigelow owns Budget Suites of America, a chain of extended-stay motels that function as housing of last resort for many low-income Nevadans.  
* **The Payoff:** The correlation between Bigelow’s business interests (eviction capability, lack of rent control) and Lombardo’s veto record is absolute. Every bill that would have regulated Bigelow’s business model was killed by the Governor's pen. This is not merely a donor relationship; it is structural dependency.

### **5.2 The Gaming Bundlers**

While Bigelow provided the war chest for the election, the gaming industry provides the sustaining capital for the administration.

* **Post-Election Surge:** Between Election Day 2022 and his inauguration, Lombardo raised nearly $2 million. This period allows donors to "buy in" to the new administration.  
* **Key Players:**  
  * **MGM Resorts:** $300,000+.39  
  * **Fertitta Family (Station Casinos):** $110,000.39  
  * **Boyd Gaming:** $150,000.39  
  * **Caesars Entertainment:** $100,000.39  
* **Policy Alignment:** The revival of the Resort Corridor Court and the A's Stadium deal act as direct subsidies to these specific donors, enhancing the value of their real estate and the security of their perimeters.

### **5.3 Dark Money Innovation: The Service First Fund**

Lombardo has pioneered a new mechanism for concealing influence in Nevada politics.

1. **Phase 1: Inauguration.** He established the "Nevada Inaugural Committee" as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit rather than a traditional PAC. This legal structure does not require donor disclosure.  
2. **Phase 2: Weaponization.** Post-inauguration, this entity was rebranded as the "Service First Fund."  
3. **Phase 3: Deployment.** The fund began running attack ads against Democratic legislators who opposed the Governor's agenda.11  
* **Implication:** This allows corporations to fund political hits on legislators without their names appearing on campaign finance reports, laundering their influence through the Governor's dark money vehicle.

## ---

**VI. Influence Web**

The governance of Nevada under Lombardo is shaped by a tight network of operatives and lobbyists.

### **6.1 The Inner Circle**

* **Ryan Cherry (Chief of Staff):** The most critical node in the influence web. Cherry is a former lobbyist who represented **National Apartment Management, LLC**, a major corporate landlord. His appointment as Chief of Staff places a direct representative of the corporate housing industry at the helm of the Governor's office, reinforcing the Bigelow nexus.4  
* **Better Nevada PAC:** The primary outside group supporting Lombardo. It engages in "astroturfing" campaigns and attack ads, often funded by the same dark money networks.41

### **6.2 The Influence Matrix**

| Interest Group | Key Representative | Financial Lever | Policy Output |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Corporate Landlords** | **Robert Bigelow**; **Ryan Cherry** | $25M+ Donations | Vetoes of SB335, AB486, AB44; Defeat of corporate homeownership caps. |
| **Resort/Gaming** | **MGM**, **Caesars**, **Wynn** | Post-election bundling | Resort Corridor Court; A's Stadium Financing; Tourism marketing subsidies. |
| **Construction/Development** | **Nevada Contractors Assoc.** | Campaign contributions | Support for A's Stadium construction jobs; Infrastructure spending. |
| **Charter School Lobby** | **Betsy DeVos Network**; **Valeria Gurr** | Advocacy spending | $38M Charter Teacher Raises 38; Continued push for vouchers. |
| **Police Unions** | **LVPPA** (Las Vegas Police Protective Assoc.) | Endorsements; Manpower | Protection of qualified immunity; Vetoes of criminal justice reform (clean slate). |

## ---

**VII. Controversies, Allegations, & Legal Matters**

### **7.1 "Badge Gate": The Ethics Violation**

During the 2022 campaign, Lombardo repeatedly used images of himself in his Sheriff's uniform and badge in campaign materials.

* **The Law:** Nevada ethics laws prohibit the use of government accouterments to secure a private interest (election).  
* **The Investigation:** The Nevada Commission on Ethics investigated. Lombardo aggressively counter-sued, challenging the Commission's jurisdiction and constitutionality.43  
* **The Resolution:** In 2025, after years of litigation funded partly by his Legal Defense Fund, a settlement was reached. Lombardo admitted to a "non-willful" violation and paid a $5,000 civil penalty (reduced from a potential $1.6 million fine for multiple violations).25  
* **Forensic Note:** The use of the Legal Defense Fund to pay lawyers for an ethics violation relating to his campaign represents a circular loop of donor money protecting the politician from accountability.46

### **7.2 The 1 October Liability War**

As Sheriff, Lombardo's handling of the 2017 mass shooting created a complex legacy.

* **The Timeline:** The LVMPD and MGM offered shifting timelines regarding when the shooter was engaged, creating confusion.  
* **The Lawsuit:** When victims sued MGM for negligence, MGM counter-sued the victims to force a settlement. Lombardo publicly defended the police response and the "single shooter" theory, aligning the department's narrative with the resort's legal defense.21  
* **Implication:** This cemented the symbiotic relationship between the police and the casinos—both had a shared interest in closing the narrative quickly to protect the city's tourism brand.

### **7.3 The 2025 Cyberattack Failure**

In August 2025, a ransomware attack crippled Nevada's state systems.

* **The Failure:** Essential services (DMV, social services) were offline for weeks.  
* **The Cost:** The state spent over $1.3 million on response and $200,000 in overtime.  
* **The Transparency Gap:** Lombardo’s administration was criticized for slow disclosure. While they claimed no personal data was exfiltrated and no ransom was paid, the lack of detail regarding the "3,200 exposed files" leaves a lingering risk.48  
* **Irony:** As Assistant Sheriff, Lombardo was in charge of LVMPD's technical services, making this failure a direct strike against his technocratic credentials.

### **7.4 Schools Over Stadiums Litigation**

The "Schools Over Stadiums" PAC sued to stop the A's Stadium funding.

* **The Ruling:** The Nevada Supreme Court rejected the referendum petition in May 2024 on technical grounds (the petition's description was "misleading").50  
* **Significance:** This legal victory for Lombardo was achieved through procedural maneuvering rather than a public vote, reinforcing the perception that the deal was forced through against the public will.

## ---

**VIII. Media, Messaging, & Behavioral Patterns**

### **8.1 The "Lawman" Shield**

Lombardo’s primary messaging strategy is the "Lawman Shield." When challenged on policy, he retreats to his identity as a Sheriff. This frames opposition not as political disagreement but as an attack on public safety. He uses this to delegitimize critics of his criminal justice policies (like the ACLU) by painting them as "soft on crime" or "anti-police".51

### **8.2 Hostility to Transparency**

The administration exhibits a behavioral pattern of secrecy.

* **Email Lawsuit:** Lombardo sued to prevent the release of emails sent from his government account to campaign consultants, arguing they were "personal." The court ruled some could be withheld, setting a precedent for executive privilege.27  
* **Dark Money:** The refusal to disclose inaugural donors and the veto of bills that would require such disclosure (SB60) indicates a deliberate strategy to obscure financial flows.52

### **8.3 Strategic Ambiguity**

On national issues, Lombardo employs strategic ambiguity. He is "pro-life" but signs abortion protections. He is "MAGA-endorsed" but vetoes fake elector schemes. This behavior is adaptive: he calculates exactly how much red meat to throw the base (trans rights vetoes) without crossing the line that would trigger a general election revolt (abortion bans).

## ---

**IX. Comparative Consistency Score**

| Principle | Action | Score | Analysis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Fiscal Responsibility** | Approved $380M Stadium Subsidy; Vetoed School Lunches | **Low** | Demonstrates "Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor." Public funds are available for billionaires (Fisher) but not for hungry students. |
| **Local Control** | Vetoed AB534 (Election Admin); Signed AB6 (School Zones) | **Mixed** | Supports local control when it aligns with his agenda, but centralized power in the Secretary of State or Governor's office when local boards (like school boards) act against him. |
| **Public Safety** | Revived Resort Corridor Court; Paid $19M in Civil Settlements | **Medium** | Defines "safety" as order maintenance in tourist zones, often at the expense of civil rights and liability costs. |
| **Transparency** | Created Service First Fund; Sued to hide emails | **Very Low** | Consistently acts to reduce public visibility into his administration's workings. |

## ---

**X. Risks, Unknowns, & Fragile Assumptions**

### **10.1 The Unemployment Anchor**

Risk: Nevada has consistently held the highest unemployment rate in the nation (approx. 5.3-5.6%) during Lombardo’s term.54  
Fragile Assumption: The administration assumes that the "substitution effect" of the A's stadium and the capital-intensive Tesla expansion will eventually trickle down to labor. If these projects fail to generate broad-based employment, his economic narrative collapses.

### **10.2 The Housing Crisis Flashpoint**

Risk: By vetoing tenant protections, Lombardo has tied his political fate to the stability of the rental market.  
Scenario: If a recession hits and evictions spike, his vetoes of SB335 and AB486 will be weaponized by opponents as the direct cause of homelessness. His alignment with Bigelow makes him uniquely vulnerable to being framed as the "Landlord's Governor."

### **10.3 The Transparency Time Bomb**

**Unknown:** The full donor list of the "Service First Fund" is unknown. If an investigative leak reveals that entities with state contracts (like construction firms building the stadium or IT vendors remediating the cyberattack) donated to this fund, it would constitute a major pay-to-play scandal.

## ---

**XI. Applied Summary**

Governor Joe Lombardo represents the triumph of **transactional governance** over ideological rigidity. He is not a culture warrior in the DeSantis mold, nor a moderate in the Hogan mold. He is a **Corporate Statist** who uses the machinery of the state—from the veto pen to the tax code—to protect and subsidize the specific coalition of real estate and gaming interests that put him in office.

**For the Voter:**

* **If you value property rights and low regulation:** Lombardo is a highly effective guardian. His vetoes have successfully blocked the regulatory state from encroaching on landlords and businesses.  
* **If you are a renter or consumer:** Lombardo is an adversary. He has systematically dismantled protections against eviction and price gouging.  
* **If you prioritize civil liberties:** His record is concerning. From the "Badge Gate" ethics violations to the "Order Out" provisions of the Resort Corridor Court, he consistently prioritizes state authority over individual rights.  
* **If you seek transparency:** His administration is a black box. The innovation of dark money inaugural funds and the fight against public records requests suggest a governance style that views public scrutiny as an impediment to be managed, not a duty to be honored.

Lombardo is a competent, ruthless operator who has mastered the art of governing by negation. He has stopped the Democratic legislature in its tracks, but his positive agenda is limited to serving the donors who pay the bills. His tenure is a test case in whether a governor can survive by serving the capital class exclusively while offering the working class only the symbolic comfort of "law and order."

## ---

**XII. Addendum: Labor & Union Entanglements**

### **12.1 The Law Enforcement Schism**

Lombardo’s relationship with organized labor is fractured along clear lines: he maintains ironclad support from local police unions while actively clashing with other public sector workers.

* **LVPPA Allegiance:** The Las Vegas Police Protective Association (LVPPA) has been Lombardo's base of power for decades. They endorsed him in the primary and general election, praising him for "protecting cops" from "radical politicians". This relationship is transactional; Lombardo vetoed criminal justice reforms that would have increased police liability or reduced qualified immunity.  
* **State Police Friction:** Conversely, his relationship with the Nevada Police Union (representing state troopers) has been volatile. As a member of the Board of Examiners, Lombardo voted against a collective bargaining agreement for state police that included a 15% pay adjustment for certain assignments, citing "operational concerns." This provoked a sharp rebuke from the union, highlighting his willingness to prioritize fiscal rigidity over "backing the blue" when it impacts the state budget directly.

### **12.2 The Service Sector Battle (Culinary Local 226\)**

Lombardo’s most significant labor conflict is with the **Culinary Workers Union Local 226**, the state's most powerful political force.

* **The SB441 Flashpoint:** In 2023, Lombardo signed **SB441**, a bill that repealed the pandemic-era mandate for daily room cleaning in hotels. This was a major legislative victory for the resort industry (MGM, Caesars, Wynn) but a devastating blow to the union, which argued it would lead to massive job cuts for guest room attendants. The union publicly labeled Lombardo a "threat to workers" who stands with "Wall Street landlords".  
* **Political Fallout:** The signing of this bill was so contentious that the Culinary Union subsequently unendorsed 18 Democratic lawmakers who voted for it, demonstrating the depth of the rupture caused by this policy.

### **12.3 The Public Sector Crackdown (AFSCME & Higher Ed)**

Lombardo has used his veto power to suppress the expansion of collective bargaining rights for state employees and educators.

* **The Retroactive Pay Veto (SB440):** Lombardo vetoed SB440, which would have funded a retroactive 3% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for state workers that had been awarded via arbitration. AFSCME Local 4041 sued the Governor, arguing he violated state law by ignoring a binding arbitration award. This veto solidified his reputation among state workers as an adversary to contract enforcement.  
* **Higher Education Barrier (AB224):** He vetoed AB224, which would have established collective bargaining rights for professional employees within the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE). In his veto message, he argued that the Board of Regents should have deference, effectively blocking faculty from unionizing under state labor laws.

### **12.4 The Hard Hat Alliance (Building Trades)**

While hostile to service and public sector unions, Lombardo cultivates a strategic alliance with the **Building Trades**.

* **Project Labor Agreements (PLAs):** His support for large-scale infrastructure projects, most notably the **Oakland A's Stadium (SB1)**, relies on the support of construction unions. The stadium deal includes provisions for Project Labor Agreements, ensuring that the jobs created are union jobs. This allows Lombardo to split the labor vote, peeling off construction workers with jobs programs while warring with the service sector over regulations.  
* **The Wedge Strategy:** This approach mirrors the "hard hat vs. soft hat" divide, where the Governor supports industrial labor (which aligns with his development goals) while suppressing public service and hospitality labor (which aligns with his regulatory opponents).

### **12.5 The Teacher Union Fracture (CCEA vs. NSEA)**

Lombardo exploited a split between the two major teacher unions.

* **CCEA Neutrality:** The **Clark County Education Association (CCEA)**, which represents teachers in the state's largest district, broke with the state union (NSEA) and declined to endorse the Democratic incumbent, Steve Sisolak, in 2022\. This non-endorsement was functionally a boost for Lombardo.  
* **The Payoff & Punishment:** In return, Lombardo signed a historic $2 billion education funding increase. However, the relationship remains transactional; he later signed a bill granting CCEA the right to strike (a move he previously opposed) but vetoed other measures they supported regarding vacancy reporting, keeping the union in a constant state of negotiation.
