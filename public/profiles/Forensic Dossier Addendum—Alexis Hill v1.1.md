### **8\. FORENSIC APPENDICES: LABOR & UNION**

#### **Appendix A: Key Event Timeline (Labor Relations)**

*Mapping the trajectory from administrator to candidate.*

* **Oct 2020:** **WCSDA (Sheriff Deputies) Endorsement Snub.** The Washoe County Sheriff Deputies Association endorses incumbent Republican Marsha Berkbigler over Hill, establishing a foundational rift with law enforcement labor.1  
* **Jan 2021:** **Hill Assumes Office.** Begins tenure as Commissioner, creating a voting record on labor contracts.  
* **July 2022:** **The "Inflation" Contracts.** Hill votes to approve a 5% COLA (retroactive) and 3.5% future COLA for WCEA (county employees) and WCSDA (deputies), cementing her reputation as a "wage-supportive" employer despite the political friction with police.  
* **May 2023:** **AFSCME Alignment.** AFSCME Local 4041 (State Workers) publicly opposes the film tax credit expansion during the legislative session, aligning with Hill’s "anti-corporate handout" stance and against the Building Trades.  
* **Aug 2023:** **Meeting Control Conflict.** Hill describes "organized groups" disrupting meetings. This rhetoric, while targeted at election deniers, alienates some populist elements within the public safety unions who view strict meeting controls as anti-democratic.  
* **Feb 2024:** **The "Locus" Donation.** Locus Development Group donates $2,500 to Hill. While not a union, this developer connection complicates her relationship with trades who may view her as selective in her anti-corporate stances.3  
* **May 2024:** **Union Primary Endorsements.**  
  * **Secured:** Northern Nevada Central Labor Council, Laborers Local 169, Culinary Union Local 226\.  
  * **Lost:** Public Safety Alliance of Nevada (PSAN) and WCSDA endorse other candidates or remain hostile.  
* **Nov 2024:** **Library Tax Failure.** Voters reject the library tax override. Hill supports a "flat budget" for FY26/27, effectively forcing the General Fund to absorb costs or trigger WCEA-contracted layoff procedures.  
* **Jan 2025:** **The Lepori Vote.** Hill’s commission advances a contract for Frank Lepori Construction (a non-union or mixed-shop donor), potentially irritating strictly unionized trades.4  
* **Ongoing (2025-2026):** **The "Hollywood 2.0" War.** The Building Trades mobilize the "Nevada Jobs Now" PAC ($1M+) to pass film tax credits. Hill remains the primary Democratic antagonist to this effort.6

**Appendix B: Evidence Table (Labor Claims & Verification)**

| Claim / Narrative | Evidence Source | Verification Status | Forensic Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **"Hill is anti-police union."** | 1 BCC Minutes 2020 \*\*\*\* NAPSO Endorsements | **Confirmed** (Political) | WCSDA endorsed her opponent in 2020\. However, her *voting record* 8 shows she approved their pay raises. The hostility is political/cultural, not administrative. |
| **"Hill supports rent control."** | 9 Camp. Statement \*\*\*\* Culinary Endorsement | **Confirmed** (Rhetorical) | She advocates for "temporary rent caps," aligning with the Culinary Union. *Constraint:* She cannot enact this unilaterally due to Dillon's Rule; it is a lobbying position. |
| **"Hill opposes union jobs."** | 10 KTNV Report 7 NV Indy Report | **Nuanced / Contextual** | False regarding public works (she votes for Prevailing Wage 11 ). True regarding *specific* film industry construction jobs dependent on tax credits she opposes. |
| **"Hill protects county staff."** | 12 WCEA Contract \*\*\*\* BCC Minutes | **Confirmed** (Administrative) | Voted for significant COLAs (8.5% over 2 years) and maintains strict contract protections against arbitrary layoffs. |
| **"Hill is funded by developers."** | 3 C\&E Reports 13 Public Comment | **Confirmed** (Financial) | Accepted $2,500 from Locus Development and $1,000 from Lepori Construction. This contradicts her "anti-corporate" branding but aligns with "pro-growth" labor (Operating Engineers). |

**Appendix C: Labor Influence Network Map (2026 Projection)**

This network analysis visualizes the fracturing of the Democratic labor coalition regarding Hill's gubernatorial bid.

**Cluster 1: The "Public Service" Coalition (Hill Allies)**

* **Base:** **WCEA** (County Staff), **AFSCME Local 4041** (State Workers), **NNCLC** (Northern Central Labor Council).  
* **Shared Interest:** Protecting the General Fund from tax giveaways; securing COLA increases; maintaining public service staffing levels.  
* **Key Signal:** AFSCME's formal opposition to the film tax credit \*\*\*\* is the "smoking gun" that proves Hill has institutional labor support for her controversial tax stance.

**Cluster 2: The "Housing & Service" Sector (Lean Hill/Toss-up)**

* **Base:** **Culinary Union Local 226** (Hospitality), **SEIU Local 1107**.  
* **Shared Interest:** Rent control, affordable housing, healthcare access.  
* **Tension:** Culinary endorsed Hill for Commission \*\*\*\* but has a long history with Aaron Ford. Hill's aggressive rent control stance appeals to their rank-and-file more than Ford's moderate approach, but Ford's incumbency is powerful.

**Cluster 3: The "Hard Hat" & Corporate Coalition (Hill Adversaries)**

* **Base:** **Southern Nevada Building Trades**, **Teamsters Local 986**, **IATSE Local 720** (Film workers).  
* **Shared Interest:** Passing the Film Tax Credit expansion to generate construction and production jobs.  
* **Key Conflict:** They view Hill's opposition to the tax credits as an existential threat to their job pipeline. They are funding the "Nevada Jobs Now" PAC  
  7  
  which will likely attack her.

**Cluster 4: The "Law & Order" Bloc (Hostile)**

* **Base:** **WCSDA** (Sheriff Deputies), **PSAN** (Public Safety Alliance).  
* **Shared Interest:** Police protections, opposition to civilian oversight/restrictive meeting rules.  
* **Status:** Historically aligned with Republicans (Berkbigler/Lombardo). Unlikely to support Hill in any scenario.

**Appendix D: Voter Decision Matrix (Labor Lens)**

*If you are a voter prioritizing...*

* **...Public Services & Government Stability:** **Vote Hill.** She prioritizes the solvency of the General Fund over tax breaks, ensuring librarians and social workers get paid.  
* **...Construction & Industrial Job Growth:** **Risk.** Her opposition to the Film Tax Credit could stall a major new industry (studios) that promises thousands of union construction jobs.  
* **...Rent Control & Housing Costs:** **Vote Hill.** She is the only major candidate explicitly campaigning on rent caps, aligning with the Culinary Union's neighborhood stability goals.  
* **...Police & Public Safety:** **Avoid.** Her relationship with law enforcement unions is fractured; they view her as adversarial to their political interests.

### **9\. FINAL STRATEGIC FORECAST**

Alexis Hill’s path to the Governor’s mansion relies on a high-risk/high-reward strategy: **splitting the labor movement.** She cannot win the "Business Labor" (Building Trades) vote against Aaron Ford. Instead, she is attempting to consolidate the **"Service Labor"** (Culinary, AFSCME, SEIU, Teachers) vote by framing the election as a choice between "Tax Breaks for Hollywood" (Ford/Trades) vs. "Services for Families" (Hill/Service Unions).

Her success depends entirely on whether the rank-and-file of the Culinary Union and AFSCME care more about *rent control and public budgets* than they do about party unity. If she can hold the North (NNCLC) and peel off the Culinary Union in the South, she has a narrow but viable path. If the Culinary Union stays with the establishment (Ford), her labor coalition collapses to just public sector administrators, which is insufficient for a statewide victory.
