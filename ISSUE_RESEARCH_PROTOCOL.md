# Civic Research Protocol: Issue-First Voter Information

A systematic methodology for producing nonpartisan, trustworthy voter guides that ground candidate positions in systemic reality.

---

## Core Principle

**Research the terrain before researching the travelers.**

Candidates make claims about issues. To evaluate those claims—and to surface meaningful contradictions—you must first understand what the issues actually are: the systems, the actors, the structural constraints, the real tradeoffs. Only then can you assess whether a candidate's position is coherent, feasible, or at odds with their record.

## Phase 1: Issue Domain Research

### 1.1 Scope Definition

For each major policy domain relevant to the election:

**Identify the domain boundaries**
- What government level controls this? (State, federal, local, or shared)
- What agencies/bodies have jurisdiction?
- What is the statutory or regulatory framework?

**Example (Nevada Energy):**
- State-level: PUCN regulates NV Energy rates
- Federal overlay: FERC on interstate transmission, EPA on emissions
- Key statutes: NRS 704 (utility regulation), NRS 704B (exit provisions)

### 1.2 Systems Mapping

Build a structural understanding before touching politics:

#### Actors & Incentives Matrix

| Actor | Primary Incentive | Secondary Incentives | Conflicts With |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| [Entity] | [What they optimize for] | [Other goals] | [Whose interests clash] |

**For each actor, document:**
- Legal/structural position (regulator, regulated entity, stakeholder)
- Revenue/funding model (how they make money or get resources)
- Accountability mechanisms (who they answer to)
- Historical behavior patterns (what they've actually done)

#### Power Flow Analysis

Map who has leverage over whom:
- Formal authority (statutory power, appointment power)
- Informal influence (lobbying, campaign contributions, public pressure)
- Veto points (who can block action)
- Information asymmetries (who knows what others don't)

### 1.3 Structural Tensions & Tradeoffs

Identify conflicts that are *inherent to the system*, not merely political disagreements:

**Template:**
```
TENSION: [Name it]
DYNAMICS: [Why this is structurally hard, not just politically contested]
TRADEOFF: [What you give up to get X]
WHO BEARS COSTS: [Distributional consequences]
WHO BENEFITS: [And when—immediate vs. long-term]
```

**Quality check:** A well-identified structural tension should be acknowledged by thoughtful people on multiple sides. If only one faction sees it as a tension, it may be a political framing rather than a structural reality.

### 1.4 Reform Option Mapping

For each major tension, identify the realistic solution space:

| Reform Option | Mechanism | Potential Benefits | Risks/Downsides | Feasibility | Who Supports | Who Opposes |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|

**Feasibility criteria:**
- Legal pathway exists (or plausible legislative route)
- Has been done elsewhere (precedent reduces uncertainty)
- Doesn't require implausible political coalitions
- Cost is within plausible budget range

**Explicitly exclude fantasy solutions:** If a reform requires constitutional amendment, federal action the state can't compel, or vast new revenue with no identified source, note it but don't treat it as a live option.

### 1.5 Source Hierarchy

Establish credibility tiers for the domain:

**Tier 1: Primary Sources**
- Statutory text (NRS, CFR)
- Regulatory orders and decisions (PUCN orders, State Engineer orders)
- Official agency data (rate filings, water rights databases)
- Court rulings

**Tier 2: Authoritative Analysis**
- Academic studies (peer-reviewed, disclosed methodology)
- Government reports (CBO, state fiscal analysis, agency studies)
- Established nonpartisan institutions (with disclosed funding)

**Tier 3: Quality Journalism**
- Reporters with domain expertise and track record
- Outlets with editorial standards and correction policies
- Local coverage with sourcing transparency

**Tier 4: Stakeholder Claims**
- Industry reports (useful but assume motivated reasoning)
- Advocacy group analyses (useful but verify independently)
- Press releases and official statements (record what they claim, verify separately)

**Document source quality in citations.** A claim backed by a PUCN order is different from one backed by an NV Energy press release.

## Phase 2: Candidate Research

### 2.1 Position Mapping

For each candidate, on each issue domain:

#### Stated Positions
- Campaign website/platform text
- Debate statements and interviews
- Endorsement questionnaire responses
- Social media (with date—positions evolve)

**Record verbatim quotes with dates and sources.** Paraphrasing introduces interpretation; quotes let readers judge.

#### Voting Record / Official Actions
- Legislative votes (if applicable)
- Executive actions (if incumbent)
- Regulatory decisions (if relevant role)
- Legal actions (if AG, prosecutor, etc.)

#### Financial Connections
- Campaign contributions by sector/actor
- PAC support and opposition
- Employment/business history relevant to the domain
- Family/associate financial interests

### 2.2 Coherence Testing

This is where Phase 1 research pays off. For each candidate position, ask:

**Internal coherence:**
- Does this position logically fit with their other positions?
- Can you hold Position A and Position B simultaneously, or do they conflict?

**Systemic coherence:**
- Does this position acknowledge the structural tradeoffs identified in Phase 1?
- If they promise X, do they address who bears the costs?
- Is the mechanism they propose actually within the power of the office they're seeking?

**Record coherence:**
- Does their stated position match their past actions?
- If there's a gap, is there an acknowledged evolution or an unacknowledged contradiction?

### 2.3 Contradiction Classification

Not all contradictions are equal. Classify them:

**Type A: Meaningful Policy Contradiction**
- Says X, did Y, and X and Y are genuinely incompatible
- Example: "Free market" rhetoric + approved $700M in corporate subsidies

**Type B: Evolution (May or May Not Be Problematic)**
- Position changed over time
- Document the change; let readers assess if it's growth or opportunism

**Type C: Rhetorical vs. Technical Mismatch**
- Campaign framing doesn't match policy nuance
- Common and often benign, but worth noting

**Type D: Superficial "Gotcha"**
- Apparent contradiction that dissolves with context
- Don't include these—they undermine credibility

**Quality check:** Before publishing a contradiction, ask: "Would a thoughtful supporter of this candidate acknowledge this as a real tension, or would they reasonably say I'm missing context?" If the latter, dig deeper or drop it.

### 2.4 Funding Analysis

Follow the money, but interpret carefully:

**Document:**
- Top donors by amount
- Sector breakdown
- PAC affiliations and their funders
- Self-funding and personal wealth

**Avoid:**
- Implying all donations are bribes
- Assuming donation = control
- Ignoring that some donations follow ideology, not interest

**Do:**
- Note when donations correlate with positions
- Note when donations come from entities with business before the official
- Let patterns speak; readers can infer

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Presentation

### 3.1 Issue Pages

For each policy domain, produce:

1. **System Overview** (from Phase 1.2)
   - Key actors and their roles
   - How decisions get made
   - Current state of play

2. **Core Tensions** (from Phase 1.3)
   - What the real tradeoffs are
   - Who bears costs under different approaches

3. **Reform Landscape** (from Phase 1.4)
   - What's actually on the table
   - What each approach would require

4. **Candidate Positions Compared**
   - Side-by-side on key questions
   - With coherence notes

5. **Civic Engagement Guide**
   - How citizens can participate
   - Where decisions are made
   - When to show up

### 3.2 Candidate Profiles

For each candidate:

1. **Background & Record**
   - Relevant experience
   - Key past actions/votes

2. **Platform Summary**
   - Stated priorities
   - Key positions by issue area

### 3.3 Presentation Principles

**Evenhandedness ≠ False Balance**
- Give comparable scrutiny to all candidates
- Don't manufacture contradictions for "balance"
- Don't suppress real findings to appear neutral
- Let the evidence be asymmetric if it is

**Show Your Work**
- Every factual claim has a citation
- Sources are accessible (linked, archived)
- Methodology is public

**Acknowledge Uncertainty**
- Some questions don't have clear answers
- Some evidence conflicts
- Say so rather than false confidence

**Separate Fact, Inference, and Opinion**
- Facts: Sourced, verifiable
- Inferences: Reasonable conclusions from facts (labeled as such)
- Opinions: Avoided, or clearly marked as editorial

## Phase 4: Maintenance & Correction

### 4.1 Update Triggers

- Candidate makes new statement/takes new action
- New data becomes available
- Source is updated or corrected
- Error is identified

### 4.2 Correction Protocol

**For factual errors:**
- Correct immediately
- Note the correction with date
- Preserve original (struck through or in note)

**For contested interpretations:**
- Add context if new evidence shifts understanding
- Note the update with date

**For outdated information:**
- Update with current info
- Note the change was temporal, not an error

### 4.3 Version Control

- Maintain dated versions
- Archive sources (they disappear)
- Log all substantive changes
