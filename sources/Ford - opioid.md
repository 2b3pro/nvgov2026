## 8. Aaron Ford – “$1.1B opioid settlements”

**Current claim:**

> “$1.1B Ford Opioid Settlements.”

**Verification (secondary reporting):**
Reputable reporting confirms that **Nevada is projected to receive more than $1 billion in aggregate opioid settlement funds** across multiple cases (Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Janssen, etc.) during Aaron Ford’s tenure as Attorney General.

* Nevada Independent (aggregate total exceeds $1B):

* Associated Press (Walgreens + multistate settlements contributing to total):

**Primary source confirmation:**
The Nevada Attorney General’s Office publicly documents opioid settlements and participating defendants. While amounts are listed per settlement rather than as a single rolled-up figure, the combined totals corroborate the ~$1.1B aggregate claim.

**Required correction (implemented):**
Clarify that **$1.1B refers to aggregate statewide opioid settlement recoveries**, not a single settlement or personal action by Ford.

**Recommended phrasing:**

> “Under Attorney General Aaron Ford, Nevada has secured more than $1 billion in *aggregate* opioid settlement recoveries from multiple pharmaceutical defendants.”
