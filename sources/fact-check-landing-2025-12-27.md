## PHASE 3: REQUIRED CORRECTIONS

### Critical Corrections

1. **C30 - Poll Date Error (CRITICAL)**
   - **Current:** "November 2024"
   - **Correction:** "November 2025"
   - **Source:** Emerson College Poll published November 21, 2025
   - **Risk:** High - Readers will doubt site accuracy

2. **C7 - Sheriff Dates (MINOR)**
   - **Current:** "Sheriff 2015-2022"
   - **Correction:** "Sheriff 2014-2022"
   - **Source:** Lombardo Profile Ref 17 (elected 2014)

### Source Improvements Needed

3. **C17 - "Food stamps to five degrees"**
   - Add Nevada Independent citation: "From food stamps to floor leader" article
   - Currently unsourced biographical claim

4. **C22 - Ford IRS Liens**
   - Replace Washington Free Beacon with Nevada Independent source
   - More neutral sourcing preferred

5. **C23 - Ford Contradiction (UPDATED)**
   - Removed ungrounded "$165M legal fees" claim
   - Replaced with grounded SB 485 contradiction (Ford killed union-backed anti-Uber bill)

## PHASE 5: ABOUT PAGE CORRECTIONS LOG

### Corrections & Modifications Log

**Update Date:** December 27, 2025

#### What Changed (Summary)
- Fixed poll date from "November 2024" to "November 2025" on landing page
- Corrected Lombardo's Sheriff tenure from "2015-2022" to "2014-2022"

The Sheriff dates were corrected to match official records showing Lombardo was elected Sheriff in 2014.

| Hansen 1.2%/849 votes | Verified | Accurate | Ballotpedia 2024 results |
| Hill camping ban vote | Verified | Accurate (voted YES, 3-2) | Nevada Independent |
