# 2026 Nevada Governor Race: Healthcare policy positions reveal stark divide

Only three of five candidates have articulated substantive healthcare positions in this race, with the Republican incumbent and Democratic frontrunner offering the most detailed—and divergent—approaches to Nevada's health challenges. Governor Joe Lombardo emphasizes enforcement and administrative reform while Attorney General Aaron Ford highlights his **$1.2 billion** in opioid settlements and ACA defense. Two Republican challengers, Irina Hansen and Matthew Winterhawk, have no documented healthcare platforms whatsoever.

This analysis examines positions across Medicaid, opioids, rural healthcare access, and mental health—revealing significant policy gaps even among leading candidates and fundamental philosophical differences in approaching Nevada's healthcare crisis.

## Medicaid: Lombardo breaks with national GOP while Democrats defend expansion

Nevada expanded Medicaid under the ACA in 2014, now covering nearly **29% of the state budget**. The candidates' positions reveal surprising cross-partisan dynamics.

**Joe Lombardo** has unexpectedly defended Medicaid expansion against his own party's proposed federal cuts. In February 2025, he warned Congress that rolling back expansion could cost Nevada between **$590 million and $3.15 billion** over the next biennium. "Nevada has demonstrated that federal investment in the state's Medicaid program has improved both health outcomes and productivity," he wrote, citing gains in school health services, lower uninsured rates, and behavioral health improvements. His budget proposes Medicaid rate increases for physicians, dentists, nursing homes, and behavioral health centers, plus a landmark **$200 million children's behavioral health investment** over three years through Medicaid. He has not taken a clear position on work requirements, with his Medicaid Administrator noting the administration is "looking at how that would affect the program."

**Aaron Ford** has been Medicaid's most aggressive legal defender. His AG office joined a 22-state coalition in July 2025 challenging Trump administration efforts to defund Planned Parenthood through Medicaid, and filed lawsuits against HHS rules threatening coverage for **100,000+ Nevadans**. Ford's personal narrative—he has publicly shared relying on Medicaid and food stamps as a single father in college—informs his policy stance. He has expressed concern about federal work requirements, noting the expansion population "typically struggles to submit paperwork on time and maintain or find employment because of unstable housing, mental illness or substance use." However, he has not articulated specific Medicaid reform proposals for his gubernatorial campaign.

**Alexis Hill** has not stated explicit Medicaid positions, though her Washoe County Commission acknowledged that "inadequate Medicaid reimbursement rate in Nevada" has created "a significant gap in accessible mental health services."

**Hansen and Winterhawk** have no documented Medicaid positions.

## Opioids: Enforcement versus harm reduction defines the debate

Nevada's opioid crisis has produced over **$1.2 billion in settlement funds**—making this perhaps the most consequential healthcare policy area in the race.

### Ford's settlement record: The $1.2 billion breakdown

Aaron Ford's AG office has secured the state's largest healthcare-related financial recovery in history:

| Settlement | Nevada's Share | Timeframe |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen | $231.7 million | 18 years |
| Walgreens | $285 million | 15 years |
| Teva Pharmaceuticals | $193 million | 2023 |
| CVS Pharmacy | $151 million | 10 years |
| Purdue Pharma/Sackler family | $58 million | 15 years |
| Johnson & Johnson/Janssen | $53.5 million | Mostly by 2022 |
| Walmart | $32.2 million | — |
| July 2025 generic manufacturers (8 companies) | $9 million | Varies |
| Other settlements | ~$190 million | Various |

These funds flow to the **Fund for a Resilient Nevada** ($462.2 million for state evidence-based programs) and cities/counties through the **One Nevada Agreement** ($370 million). Ford's office has directed settlement dollars to organizations including Boys & Girls Club and foster care programs.

### The harm reduction divide

Ford's policy evolution on fentanyl reveals the race's central opioid tension. In 2019, he supported AB 236, raising drug trafficking thresholds to 100 grams as part of criminal justice reform. By 2023, he backed SB 35, which lowered fentanyl thresholds to **4-28 grams**, created mandatory minimums, and controversially removed fentanyl from Good Samaritan law protections. "What we've learned is that lowering the thresholds for all drugs was overinclusive," Ford explained, while acknowledging: "I've had dreams, and frankly nightmares, over ensuring that in pursuit of this bill that we don't re-create the war on drugs from the crack cocaine days."

**Lombardo** has pursued a primarily enforcement-based approach, consistent with his law enforcement background. His **Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act (SB457)** introduces harsher sentences including mandatory minimums for fentanyl trafficking. However, the bill also requires correctional facilities to work with DHHS on treatment programs and includes medication-assisted treatment within jails and prisons. His administration faces criticism for allegedly diverting **$10 million** in opioid settlement dollars to programs critics say don't directly address the epidemic—including TANF, foster care, and youth facility upgrades. Ryan Hampton, an addiction recovery advocate, charged: "We believe these funds were born from tragedy and were intended for healing, and that they're being diverted to plug budget gaps."

**Notable gap**: Lombardo has made no significant statements supporting harm reduction measures like expanded naloxone access, fentanyl test strips, or syringe services programs.

**Alexis Hill's** Washoe County Commission has overseen **$41 million** in opioid settlement allocations over 20 years, funding treatment-oriented programs including Northern Nevada HOPES' opioid treatment program and Bristlecone Family Resources' 20-bed medical detox center. The county-funded organizations provide free naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and needle exchange—suggesting Hill leans toward harm reduction, though she has not made explicit policy statements.

## Rural healthcare: Lombardo leads with $200 million federal application

With **81.6%** of rural and frontier Nevadans living in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas, rural healthcare access represents a critical campaign issue—yet only Lombardo has articulated specific proposals.

Lombardo's **Nevada Healthcare Access Act (SB495)** creates a **$25 million annual Workforce Access Fund** targeting rural and underserved areas, plus **$50 million** for graduate medical education programs. In December 2025, his administration applied for **$200 million annually** in federal Rural Health Transformation Program funds, proposing:

- **$80 million/year**: Healthcare workforce recruitment, tuition assistance tied to rural service, rural physician residency programs
- **$40 million/year**: Rural health infrastructure modernization, mobile units, emergency services
- **$30 million/year**: Chronic disease management through the Rural Health Outcomes Accelerator Program
- **$30 million/year**: Telehealth infrastructure and health data systems

"As Governor, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges rural Nevadans face trying to get the care they need," Lombardo stated. His administration also signed SB97 and SB312 in 2025 to expand tribal healthcare opportunities.

**Ford** has not articulated a rural healthcare platform despite Nevada's significant challenges. His AG office sued HHS over grant cuts affecting the Central Nevada Health District (3 employees laid off) and rural-serving crisis stabilization centers, but he has made no specific policy proposals for rural hospital preservation or workforce shortages.

**Hill** has concrete accomplishments on rural connectivity enabling telehealth—Washoe County completed broadband expansion to rural Gerlach and Empire in 2024, connecting 74 of 108 homes. However, she has not articulated gubernatorial-level rural healthcare policy positions.

**This represents the most significant policy gap across Democratic candidates**: neither Ford nor Hill has proposed solutions for rural hospital funding, healthcare workforce shortages, or community health center support.

## Mental health: County-level experience versus statewide infrastructure

Mental health policy reveals the clearest distinction between Hill's local government experience and Lombardo's statewide executive actions.

**Lombardo** has built statewide mental health infrastructure through his **Nevada Healthcare Access Act**, which creates a new **Office of Mental Health** within the Nevada Health Authority. His 988 crisis system investments include:

- Signing SB237 (2023) creating a 35-cent cell phone surcharge generating **$15 million annually** for 988 funding
- Requiring AB135's mandate for 988 numbers on all Nevada student IDs
- Approving **$10 million** for 988 call center expansion
- Co-locating 988 counselors with 911 dispatchers in Clark and Washoe counties

His **$200 million children's behavioral health investment** through Medicaid represents the largest youth mental health commitment in state history. However, he vetoed AB265 (statewide mental health consortium) and AB201 (children's behavioral health oversight) in 2023—creating a contradiction between his stated priorities and legislative actions.

**Hill** has the strongest documented mental health record through Washoe County actions. Her flagship achievement: the **Washoe Behavioral Health Center**, transforming the former West Hills Behavioral Health Hospital into a **$23 million, 70-bed facility** (expected opening late 2027) with half dedicated to youth services. "This is a big deal and a big day for our community," Hill stated at the 2023 acquisition. "For so long we've said, 'That's the State's job,' but the State isn't able to do it so the County is trying to find partners."

Her Commission also:
- Hired Washoe County's first Behavioral Health Administrator
- Secured **$15 million** for jail-based mental health programs through June 2027
- Transferred and expanded Mobile Crisis Response Teams (doubling call capacity)
- Adopted the Sequential Intercept Model to divert individuals with mental illness from the justice system

**Ford** has pursued youth mental health through litigation against Meta and YouTube, claiming platforms "promote dangerous challenges and inappropriate content to underage users, contributing to real-world harms like self-injury and exploitation." His AG office sued HHS over grant cuts affecting behavioral health services. However, he lacks a comprehensive mental health policy platform and has not stated positions on 988 implementation or mental health parity.

## Campaign finance and healthcare industry connections

Healthcare industry influence varies significantly across candidates with available financial records.

**Lombardo** received **$80,000+** in pharmaceutical-related donations after vetoing AB250 (2023), a prescription drug price cap bill—compared to just ~$11,000 from pharma while running for governor in 2022. Democrats accused him of being influenced by "big drug companies." Additionally, he enlisted Mike Willden, a lobbyist with healthcare clients including entities with Medicaid contracts, to help build his state budget during transition.

**Ford's** campaign is primarily funded by trial lawyers (Nevada Justice Association/Citizens for Justice PAC). His AG office contracted with his former law firm (Eglet Prince) to pursue opioid litigation, drawing conflict-of-interest scrutiny.

**Hill, Hansen, and Winterhawk** have no documented healthcare industry donor connections—Hill's county commission campaign had approximately $129,504 as of January 2024, while Winterhawk runs an explicit "zero-dollar campaign" accepting no donations.

## Two Republican challengers offer no healthcare vision

**Irina Hansen** and **Matthew Winterhawk** present the most significant information gap in this race. Despite extensive searches of campaign materials, news coverage, candidate surveys, and social media:

**Hansen** (1.2% in 2024 Las Vegas mayoral primary) has no documented positions on Medicaid, opioids, rural healthcare, or mental health. Her only healthcare-adjacent statement from the mayoral race referenced supporting "policies that allocate resources for mental health and addiction treatment" for homeless populations—without specifics. Her 2026 gubernatorial website lists policy pages on education, housing, Second Amendment, judicial reform, and election integrity, but includes no healthcare page.

**Winterhawk** (SmartSlaps founder, hip-hop artist) has healthcare entirely absent from his platform, which focuses on government efficiency ("state D.O.G.E."), education reform, and land sovereignty. He completed Ballotpedia's candidate survey without mentioning healthcare. As a self-funded, "zero-dollar" campaign, he has received minimal media coverage.

Neither candidate appears competitive in polling.

## Conclusion: Substantive gaps persist despite high-stakes environment

Nevada's 2026 gubernatorial race on healthcare reveals three distinct candidate profiles:

**Lombardo** offers the most comprehensive documented record—defending Medicaid expansion against his party, pursuing enforcement-focused opioid policy, investing significantly in rural healthcare infrastructure, and building statewide mental health systems. His contradictions (pharmaceutical donations after drug-price vetoes, alleged opioid fund diversion, vetoing mental health oversight bills) provide attack vectors for opponents.

**Ford** brings unmatched credentials on opioid litigation and ACA defense, but his gubernatorial healthcare platform remains underdeveloped. His evolution from harm reduction to enforcement on fentanyl will draw scrutiny from both progressives and law-and-order conservatives. The absence of rural healthcare and comprehensive mental health proposals represents a significant gap for a statewide candidate.

**Hill** demonstrates the strongest local-government mental health accomplishments but has not translated her county-level expertise into a gubernatorial healthcare platform. Her silence on Medicaid, rural healthcare, and opioid policy specifics limits voter understanding of her statewide vision.

**Hansen and Winterhawk** have articulated nothing on healthcare, making them non-factors on these issues.

For voters prioritizing healthcare, the race offers a clear choice between Lombardo's incumbent record and Ford's litigation-based credentials—with Hill's local experience as a potential primary alternative. The Republican challengers have ceded the field entirely on one of Nevada's most pressing policy areas.
