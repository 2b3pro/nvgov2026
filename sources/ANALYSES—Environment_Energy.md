# 2026 Nevada Governor's Race: Environmental and Energy Voter Guide

Nevada faces an inflection point on water, energy, and mining policy as five candidates vie for the governorship. **Incumbent Joe Lombardo has an extensive record marked by contradictions**—signing key water legislation while withdrawing from climate commitments and appointing fossil fuel allies. **Aaron Ford brings a perfect environmental voting record** from his legislative days but has left major gaps on water and lithium. **Alexis Hill offers the clearest climate action credentials** at the county level but faces scrutiny over Lake Tahoe development votes. **Challengers Irina Hansen and Matthew Winterhawk have articulated virtually no positions** on Nevada's most pressing environmental issues.

---

## Joe Lombardo (R, Incumbent)

### Water & Colorado River: Mixed Record

Governor Lombardo has navigated Colorado River negotiations while signing significant water conservation legislation—though critics note he's followed rather than led.

**Key Actions:**
- **Signed AB 220 (2023):** Empowered SNWA to restrict single-family water use to **163,000 gallons/year** if Nevada's allocation drops below 270,000 acre-feet. Backed by Sierra Club and Great Basin Water Network.
- **May 2023:** Joined Arizona and California governors announcing **3 million acre-foot conservation plan** through 2026.
- **December 2025:** Urged seven-state agreement in letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum: *"A seven-state agreement remains the preferred path... The challenges we face are significant and addressing them requires urgency."*
- **Signed SB 6 (2025):** Funded cloud seeding program through 2027 (adds ~56,000 acre-feet annually).

**Gaps:** SB 176 (water rights buyback program) died without a vote. AB 109 (groundwater regulatory expansion) failed.

---

### Energy & NV Energy: Industry-Aligned

Lombardo has maintained NV Energy's monopoly status while his appointees approved rate structures unfavorable to rooftop solar customers. His **withdrawal from the U.S. Climate Alliance** made him the only governor elected in 2022 to exit the coalition.

**Key Actions:**
- **Executive Order 2023-007:** Established "balanced" energy policy explicitly including natural gas alongside renewables—critics say this undermines Nevada's **50% renewable by 2030** mandate.
- **July 5, 2023:** Withdrew Nevada from U.S. Climate Alliance, stating goals *"conflict with Nevada's energy policy objectives."*
- **Appointed fossil fuel lobbyist** Dwayne McClinton (Southwest Gas) as Director of Governor's Office of Energy.
- **PUC appointments** approved NV Energy rate increases and new **$20-30/month demand charges** on solar customers (September 2025).
- **Supports Greenlink Nevada** transmission project ($4.2 billion); wrote to DOI advocating for stalled solar projects in August 2025.

**Direct Quote on Climate Exit:** Nevada Conservation League Executive Director Paul Selberg: *"We are outraged by Governor Lombardo's nonsensical withdrawal... He took this action without consulting everyday Nevadans."*

**Campaign Finance:** Received **$40,000 in bundled contributions from NV Energy** (2022); $10,000+ from Southwest Gas.

---

### Lithium Mining: Strong Advocate

Lombardo has made lithium development a centerpiece of his economic agenda, calling Thacker Pass Nevada's *"long-term economic salvation."*

**Key Positions:**
- **March 2024 (Thacker Pass tour):** *"Nevada has the natural resources to be the world leader in lithium battery development... I'm proud of all the work that's being done to invest in our state's economy."*
- **September 2025 Lithium Summit:** Described lithium as helping Nevada become *"recession-proof."*
- Supports **"Lithium Loop"** concept—Nevada is the only state with complete lithium lifecycle from mining to recycling.

**Indigenous Rights:** No significant legislation addressing tribal concerns at Thacker Pass. Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes were consulted under federal permits issued before Lombardo took office.

---

### Sustainable Growth: Skeptical on Climate Science

Lombardo has vetoed multiple environmental protection bills while signing some conservation measures with bipartisan support.

**Key Vetoes:**
- **SB 169 (2023):** Heat mitigation planning. Veto message claimed *"there is no data definitively supporting the proposition that development is causing rising temperatures"*—despite Las Vegas and Reno being the two fastest-warming U.S. cities.
- **SB 76 (2023):** PFAS ("forever chemicals") ban—said state should wait for EPA guidance.
- **AB 97 (2023, 2025):** Refrigerant transition legislation—vetoed twice.

**Key Signed:**
- **AB 131 (2023):** Urban forestry program for heat mitigation.
- **AB 184 (2023):** Clean Trucks and Buses Incentive Program.
- **AB 112 (2023):** Wildlife crossings ($5 million appropriation).

**Contradictions:** Claims to support clean energy while withdrawing from climate coalition. Wrote letter supporting solar development while his PUC appointments approved policies harming rooftop solar customers. Major donors (NV Energy, Southwest Gas) benefit from his administration's policies.

---

## Aaron Ford (D, Attorney General)

### Water & Colorado River: Notable Gap

Despite chairing the Senate Natural Resources Committee, Ford has **not articulated water policy positions** for his gubernatorial campaign—a significant omission given the February 2026 deadline for Colorado River negotiations.

**Legislative Record:** Voted YES on SB 512 (2017) funding Lake Tahoe conservation. Named **"Senator of the Year" by Nevada Conservation League (2013)** for environmental work.

**AG Actions:** No direct litigation found on water issues.

---

### Energy & NV Energy: Consumer Advocate

Ford's AG office has aggressively challenged NV Energy on rate structures and defended federal solar funding.

**Key Actions:**
- **2025:** Bureau of Consumer Protection called NV Energy's daily demand charge **"unlawful"** and filed judicial review petition in Clark County District Court.
- **October 2025:** Filed lawsuit to recover **$155.7 million** in Solar for All funds frozen by Trump administration.
- **Direct Quote:** *"President Trump has tried to illegally claw back funds from Nevada after hardworking residents of our state have put in the work to address our energy needs."*

**Legislative Record (2017):** Voted YES on AB 206 (More Renewable Energy), AB 405 (Restoring Rooftop Solar), SB 392 (Community Solar Gardens), and five other clean energy bills—achieving **100% Nevada Conservation League score**.

**Nuclear (Yucca Mountain):** Strongly opposed. Filed motions to permanently kill NRC licensing: *"Nevadans have long been clear that Yucca Mountain is an untenable and intolerable site for the dumping of nuclear waste."*

---

### Lithium Mining: Complete Silence

Ford has made **no public statements** on Thacker Pass, the Lithium Loop, or mining policy generally—a critical gap given the project's prominence and ongoing tribal opposition.

---

### Sustainable Growth: Strong Legislative Record, Campaign Gap

**Legislative Record (96% lifetime NCL score):**
- Voted YES on AB 277 (Protect National Conservation Areas), AB 379 (Parks funding), AJR 13 (Celebrating National Monuments), SJR 13 (Wildlife funding).
- Acknowledged human-caused climate change in Yucca Mountain filings.

**2026 Campaign:** Launch focused on housing, healthcare, education—environmental issues **not prominently featured**. No comprehensive climate platform released.

**Contradictions:** Strong 2017 voting record versus silence on lithium mining and absent water policy in 2026 campaign.

---

## Alexis Hill (D, Washoe County Commissioner)

### Water & Regional Issues: Active Board Member

As Washoe County Commission Chair, Hill serves on the **Truckee Meadows Water Authority Board** (serving 440,000+ residents) but operates in the Truckee River basin rather than Colorado River system.

**Key Positions:**
- **Supports Sen. Rosen's Truckee Meadows Public Lands Management Act:** Would designate 223,109 acres as Wilderness and 456,292 acres as National Conservation Areas.
- **Opposes Rep. Amodei's land sale amendment:** *"Nevada's public lands will be purchased by developers, and then the proceeds will go towards the richest community members in the United States."*

**Lake Tahoe Controversy:** As TRPA Governing Board member, voted for higher-density development in Tahoe town centers for workforce housing. **Sierra Club Tahoe Area Group criticized** Hill for *"supporting luxury development over workforce housing"* (April 2023). Hill responded: *"I don't always listen to the loudest voices in the room. I actually listen to our diverse community."*

---

### Energy & Climate: County-Level Leader

Hill authored Washoe County's first Community Climate Action Plan and hired the county's first Sustainability Manager.

**Key Actions:**
- **Climate Action Plan Introduction:** *"Our region is particularly vulnerable to a changing climate. The Reno area is the fastest-warming metro in the country... I am so excited to implement this plan for a better more resilient future."*
- **Net Zero 2050 Goal:** County committed under her leadership.
- **$100,000 IRA grant:** Secured for green energy planning in rural Gerlach.
- Celebrated $9.14 billion in Nevada clean energy investments from Inflation Reduction Act.

**Gaps:** No specific positions found on NV Energy's monopoly, Greenlink transmission, rooftop solar/net metering, or nuclear energy.

---

### Lithium Mining: Indirect Support Only

No direct statements on Thacker Pass. Washoe County's Climate Action Plan (which Hill endorsed) references the **"Lithium Loop"** as bringing *"billions of dollars of investment to create a circular battery economy."*

Supported Truckee Meadows Lands Bill provisions for **tribal co-management** with Reno Sparks Indian Colony and Pyramid Paiute Tribe.

---

### Sustainable Growth: Smart Growth vs. Development Tensions

**Platform Positions:**
- Supports infill development, ADUs, and tiny homes for housing affordability.
- Opposes corporate tax giveaways: *"Tax giveaways like what the State Legislature gave to Elon Musk to bring Tesla to Washoe County do not work, and as your governor, I will work to dismantle those."*

**TRPA Development Votes (August 2025):** Supported housing amendments allowing greater density, taller buildings (up to 65 feet), and reduced parking at Lake Tahoe—prompting lawsuit from Tahoe Sierra Clean Air Coalition over wildfire evacuation concerns.

**Endorsements:**
- **Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter:** Endorsed 2020, 2024
- **Nevada Conservation League:** Endorsed 2024

**Contradictions:** Sierra Club statewide endorsements versus Tahoe Area Group criticism of development votes. Dismissed CalMatters investigative reporting on TRPA as *"misinformation"* and *"quote unquote journalism."*

---

## Irina Hansen (R, Challenger)

### All Topics: No Documented Positions

**Background:** Born in Romania (1978), real estate agent for 21+ years, salon owner. Lost 2024 Las Vegas mayoral primary with ~1% of vote (849 votes). **No prior elected office**.

Hansen's campaign website covers education, housing, Second Amendment, judicial reform, veterans, election integrity, and sanctuary policies. **Environmental, water, energy, and mining issues are entirely absent.**

**Campaign Focus:** Self-described "outsider" challenging Lombardo from the right. Claims 2024 election was *"rigged"* and product of *"a broken and manipulated election system."*

| Topic | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Water/Colorado River | ❌ None documented |
| Energy/NV Energy | ❌ None documented |
| Lithium/Mining | ❌ None documented |
| Climate/Sustainable Growth | ❌ None documented |

**Possible Inference:** General anti-regulation stance suggests skepticism toward environmental rules, but **no explicit statements** confirm this.

**Endorsements/Donors:** None identified. Campaign describes itself as "grassroots."

---

## Matthew Winterhawk (R/Independent, Challenger)

### Water: General Statement Only

**Only documented position:** *"We must protect our water"* (Ballotpedia survey). Listed *"defending Nevada's rights over our land and water"* as a priority, framed as anti-federal sovereignty issue.

**No positions on:** Colorado River crisis, Lake Mead, SNWA, conservation measures, interstate compacts, desalination.

---

### Energy: No Positions

Winterhawk has made **no public statements** on energy policy—no positions on NV Energy, renewables, Greenlink, solar, nuclear, or grid reliability.

---

### Lithium/Mining: No Specific Positions

No statements on Thacker Pass despite it being Nevada's largest economic development project. His Nevada Land Sovereignty and Reclamation Act (NLSARA) proposes keeping *"all profits from land leases, grazing, mining, and resource use"* in Nevada and transferring federal land management to state control—which could affect mining permitting.

---

### Public Lands: Primary Focus

**NLSARA (Nevada Land Sovereignty and Reclamation Act)** is Winterhawk's only detailed environmental-adjacent policy:
- Proposes state control of federal lands (~80% of Nevada)
- Ban federal road closures and access restrictions
- Keep all resource revenue in-state
- Protect wild horses through *"Nevada-controlled conservation"*
- Require public vote before federal land acquisition

**Direct Quote:** *"Nevada is not federal property. It is home to the Battle Born, and it is time to act like it."*

**Climate Change:** Not mentioned anywhere on campaign website.

**Background:** First-time candidate from Kansas City running **zero-dollar campaign** without PAC support. No Indigenous heritage (despite name). Listed as *"not polling significantly."*

---

---

## Critical Information Gaps

**Aaron Ford:** No water policy despite February 2026 Colorado River deadline. Complete silence on Thacker Pass. 2026 environmental platform undeveloped.

**Alexis Hill:** No positions on statewide energy issues (NV Energy, Greenlink, net metering). No direct statement on Thacker Pass.

**Irina Hansen:** No documented positions on any environmental, water, energy, or mining issue. Campaign platform excludes these topics entirely.

**Matthew Winterhawk:** Only articulated land sovereignty position. No specific policies on water, energy, mining, or climate despite Nevada facing critical decisions in all areas.

---

## Conclusion

The 2026 race presents **stark contrasts on environmental governance**. Governor Lombardo offers a record—flawed by his climate alliance withdrawal and fossil fuel appointments, but substantive on water and mining. Ford's legislative history demonstrates environmental commitment, yet his gubernatorial campaign has **critical policy gaps** on water and lithium that voters should press him to fill. Hill brings genuine climate action credentials from county government but faces questions about Lake Tahoe development trade-offs. The Republican challengers Hansen and Winterhawk have failed to engage with Nevada's most pressing environmental issues, offering voters little guidance on how they would govern.

With Colorado River negotiations facing a February 2026 deadline, lithium development reshaping Northern Nevada, and NV Energy's monopoly facing mounting consumer opposition, the next governor will shape Nevada's environmental trajectory for decades. Voters seeking detailed positions should demand more from candidates who have thus far remained silent on these defining challenges.
