          Crime is Nevada's most emotionally charged political issue. The 2019 passage of AB 236—a sweeping
          criminal justice reform bill—reduced prison populations but became a flashpoint. Opponents blame
          it for increased retail theft and drug crimes. Supporters say it saved money and reduced
          over-incarceration. Both sides cherry-pick statistics.

                is politically dangerous. Lombardo's ads will hammer this relentlessly.

            Both sides agree: <strong>AB 236's original fentanyl provisions were inadequate.</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            When AB 236 passed in 2019, fentanyl wasn't the dominant drug threat it is today. The bill
            initially treated fentanyl similarly to other narcotics—with weight-based thresholds that
            didn't account for fentanyl's extreme potency (a lethal dose is measured in milligrams).
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>• Nevada fentanyl deaths increased 300%+ from 2019-2023</li>
            <li>• Legislators (including Ford's allies) supported tougher fentanyl penalties in 2023</li>
            <li>• Lombardo signed these updates—but frames it as "cleaning up Democrats' mess"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>The takeaway:</strong> AB 236's fentanyl provisions were a genuine mistake that reformers
            acknowledge. But Lombardo's framing ignores that fentanyl exploded nationally—not just in Nevada,
            and not just because of AB 236.

            Crime is Lombardo's strongest issue. He has the biography (Sheriff), the policy position
            (repeal/modify AB 236), and the attack line ("Aaron Ford made Nevada less safe").
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Ford is on defense. He can argue the reform was smart policy, but "smart" doesn't resonate
            when voters feel unsafe. His pivot to "law enforcement support" may seem opportunistic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hill has the cleanest hands—she wasn't involved in AB 236 and has a "tough" homelessness vote
            on her record. But she lacks Lombardo's credibility on the issue and Ford's statewide platform.
