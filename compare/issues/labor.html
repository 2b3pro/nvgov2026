          Nevada's labor landscape is uniquely fractured. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 is the state's most
          powerful political force, capable of mobilizing tens of thousands of hospitality workers. The Building
          Trades want film tax credits and construction jobs. Police unions distrust reform candidates. Teacher
          unions are split between state and local chapters. The 2026 race will be decided by which candidate
          can hold together—or strategically split—this fragile coalition.

                Ford killed SB485, a taxi union-backed bill imposing 15-minute waits on Uber/Lyft, calling it
                "bad policy." He sided with tech companies over union demands when tourism dollars were at stake.
                Also, Ford voted FOR police raises that Lombardo vetoed—an attempt to peel off cops from their
                Republican allegiances, despite his criminal justice reform record making police unions wary.

      <h2 class="section-header text-nevada-navy">What They're Not Telling You</h2>
      <div class="mt-8 bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl p-8">
        <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Fractured Labor Coalition</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Nevada's labor movement is <strong>not monolithic</strong>. The 2026 election exposes deep fractures:
          </p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Culinary vs. Building Trades:</strong> The Culinary Union wants rent control and worker
              protections. The Building Trades want film tax credits and stadium construction jobs. These
              priorities directly conflict—every dollar to Hollywood is a dollar not spent on housing programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CCEA vs. NSEA:</strong> The Clark County Education Association (state's largest teacher
              local) has broken with the state-level Nevada State Education Association. CCEA even endorsed
              Lombardo in 2022 to gain leverage. Ford aligns with NSEA; this costs him the largest local's ground game.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Police Unions:</strong> Law enforcement unions historically back Republicans, but
              Lombardo vetoed their pay raises while Ford voted for them. Yet Ford's criminal justice
              reform record (AB 236) makes police view him as an "existential threat."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public vs. Private Sector:</strong> AFSCME (state workers) officially opposed the
              film tax credit—aligning with Hill's anti-corporate stance. This puts public sector unions
              against private sector construction unions on a major policy fight.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>The bottom line:</strong> No candidate can win ALL of labor. The question is which
            coalition proves more valuable: Ford's establishment broad tent, Hill's service-sector focus,
            or Lombardo's strategic wedge that picks off construction workers while alienating hospitality.
